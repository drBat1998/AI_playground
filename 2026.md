# The Checklist:

1. **Read 12 books in 2026**
    
2. **Write an essay** (something like a standard 5 paragraph essay: intro w/ thesis statement, 3 supporting body paragraphs, conclusion)
    
3. **Write a book review** (3/4ths summary | 1/4th analysis and opinion)
    
4. **Write a poem** (bonus points if you rhyme!)
    
5. **Start (or restart) playing an instrument**
    
6. **Start Studying Math, Logic, or both**
    
7. **Start (restart, or continue) something physical and tough** - weightlifting, martial arts (I recommend Brazilian jiujitsu or Muay Thai), etc.
    
8. **Keep a Nature Log** (read [THIS POST](https://parknotes.substack.com/p/keep-a-nature-log-and-bloom-where) for more on that)
    
9. **Write a Short Story**
    
10. **Start reading the Bible** (this will help you better understand the Western civilization that gave rise to the Renaissance. Try a Bible in a year plan and go at your own pace)
