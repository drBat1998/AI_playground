> What does MHC 1 present?

It was not my ==concern== until this day when ==I was preparing for== my pathophysiology exam, I heard a lot that MHC I is a tool to recognize our own cells by the immune system and that this molecule ==participates== in virus protein presentation. So, I want ==answers==, about how these molecules ==distinguish== our proteins from virus one, and spoiler ==alert== they do not. MHC I present all peptides that are produced at the given moment by the cell and prepared by the proteasome.
