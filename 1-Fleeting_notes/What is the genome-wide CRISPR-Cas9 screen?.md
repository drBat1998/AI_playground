What is the genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen?

Chat GPT: The method uses CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to introduce targeted mutations into genes in a pooled, high-throughput manner. Instead of editing one gene at a time, a library of thousands of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) is designed—usually covering all protein-coding genes in the genome. Each sgRNA directs the Cas9 nuclease to a specific gene, where it introduces a double-strand break, leading to loss of function through insertions/deletions (indels).

Why CRISPR replaced RNAi in most cases
Because CRISPR yields permanent, specific, and more complete gene inactivation, it produces stronger and cleaner phenotypes, reducing the high false-positive/false-negative rates seen with RNAi.
