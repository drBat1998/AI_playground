# Notes
## Introduction 
Ischemic diseases remain among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, alongside cancer. Oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) is a well-known in vitro model for studying ischemic conditions. This model simulates the nutrient and oxygen loss that occurs during ischemia and is used not only in stroke research[^7], but also in the study of other ischemic conditions such as retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury[^6], spinal cord injury[^8], glaucoma[^10], vascular dementia[^15], and intestinal and hepatic ischemia[^16][^30].

Cell loss during ischemia is a crucial component of ischemic pathogenesis that has been and remains in the scope of interest for multiple research groups. For years, apoptosis dominated the research on ischemic cell death. However, evidence suggests that caspase inhibition, while protective, does not completely prevent neuronal loss. This indicates that additional, caspase-independent mechanisms play a significant role in ischemia-related cell death[^2].

In the last few decades, there has been a great shift in the scope toward the investigation of regulated necrosis. The most prominent regulated necrosis pathways in oxygen-glucose deprivation are ferroptosis, pyroptosis, parthanatos, and necroptosis. Necroptosis is a regulated form of necrosis mediated primarily by receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1(RIPK1), receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), and  Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein(MLKL), and was first observed in ischemic conditions by Degterev and colleagues.

Growing evidence suggests that necroptosis should be considered alongside apoptosis as a therapeutic target. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of necroptosis in the context of oxygen-glucose deprivation, highlighting its molecular mechanisms, key regulatory proteins, and the growing evidence of its relevance in ischemic injury models.
## Necroptosis
## Classic components
Necroptosis is a form of regulated cell death (RCD) that manifests morphologically as necrosis, characterized by cell swelling and permeabilization of the cellular membrane. The Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death in 2018 proposed defining necroptosis as a type of RCD triggered by extracellular or intracellular perturbation of homeostasis that depends on MLKL and RIPK3 kinase activity[^1]. In contrast to apoptosis, few articles suggest the possible implementation of necroptosis in a physiological context. Moreover, genetic disruption of RIPK3 and MLKL does not reveal any phenotypic problems, indicating that their functions are primarily pathophysiological[^12][^34].

Different death receptors, including TNFR1, TLR3, TLR4, and ZBP1, detect the perturbation and initiate the execution of the cell by necroptosis. TNFR1 engagement in necroptosis is the best-characterized so far. TNF binding to the receptor may initiate three pathways. The first and most common is the RIPK1-dependent NF-κB pathway activation, which promotes cell survival and the inflammatory response by initiating Complex I. Complex I consists of TNF-receptor-associated factor 2, RIPK1, cIAP1, cIAP2, and LUBAC. cIAPs and LUBAC promote RIPK1 ubiquitination. This leads to the creation of a platform that promotes NF-κB and MAPK pathway activation. During severe perturbations such as ischemia, Complex I is inactivated by the lysine 63 deubiquitinase CYLD. CYLD removes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIPK1, thereby facilitating the transition to Complex II. Interestingly, Feng et al. reported that activation of the p38 MAPK pathway leads to upregulation of CYLD, which in turn promotes apoptosis or necroptosis in primary cortical neurons under ischemic conditions[^11]. The second pathway, mediated by Complex II, initiates apoptosis by CASP8.

On the other hand, Complex II can convert to a necrosome, mediated by CASP8 inactivation or RIPK3 overexpression. Autophosphorylation or cross-phosphorylation of the necrosome components, RIPK1 and RIPK3, leads to amyloid-like structures and the recruitment of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein. MLKL, as a consequence, undergoes phosphorylation at serine 358 in humans (Ser358) or serine 345 in mice (Ser345) residues. This phosphorylation promotes oligomerization and pore formation that disrupts membrane integrity and executes the cell by necroptosis[^45]. RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL are generally accepted as classic components of necroptosis, and thus most explicitly studied.

In contrast to apoptosis, in which the apoptotic bodies are shortly removed by macrophages, showing little immune response, necroptosis leads to a robust immune response. Moreover, during apoptosis, caspases cleave various molecules (e.g., PLA2, IL-33, HMGB1), reducing their immunogenicity. Necroptosis, by contrast, lacks caspase activity and is characterized by plasma membrane rupture, lysosomal leakage, and the release of intact nuclei and organelles. This leads to an abundant and more immunogenic pool of DAMPs, including full-length IL-33, mtDNA, and reduced HMGB1.[^16][^38]. 

## other necroptosis components
[[VDAC1 and necroptosis]]
Upon activation, MLKL targets not only the plasma membrane but also other membrane-bound organelles, such as lysosomes, nuclei, and mitochondria. In order to understand the role of MLKL in mitochondria, Wan and colleagues performed a set of experiments. They showed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting (WB) that MLKL directly interacts with VDAC1. Moreover, genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting MLKL or VDAC1 leads to decreased levels of ROS and Ca²⁺, and overall necroptosis suppression. VDAC1 is known to upregulate mitochondrial permeability, which leads to the leakage of cytochrome c, mtDNA, intracellular Ca²⁺, and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the authors speculated that MLKL promotes VDAC1 oligomerization. In addition to necroptosis, this pathway may also lead to intrinsic apoptosis, indicating a connection between different cell-death pathways and promoting the concept of PANoptosis. [^47][^48]

CAMK2 
Execution of the cell via necroptosis is not limited to MLKL-related permeabilization of the membrane. Regulated necrosis has another important substrate: calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CAMK2D). CaMKII is a serine-threonine kinase involved in calcium regulation. It is a well-validated nodal signal that promotes cardiomyocyte death through several pathways and can execute cell death independently of MLKL[^13]. Wang et al. showed that during brain ischemia in a mouse model, both in vitro and in vivo, MLKL activity is induced alongside CaMKII activity. RIPK3 induces CaMKII activity in both cardiomyocytes[^46] and cortical neurons[^32]. CaMKII promotes the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), so an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration leads to calcium overload. These findings demonstrate that RIPK3 is central to the necroptosis process and can activate necroptosis through multiple pathways[^32]. What is even more peculiar is that Zhang et al in cardiomyocytes indicate that RIPK1 and MLKL are not essential parts of necroptosis, in contrast to CaMKII and RIPK3[^46].

Heat shock protein 90α (HSP90α) is a molecular chaperone and plays a crucial role in protein folding, stabilization, and trafficking under both normal and stress conditions. Wang et al. showed that HSP90 could directly bind to RIPK3 and RIPK1 and promote their stability. Moreover, both pharmacological (geldanamycin) and genetic inhibition of HSP90α lead to decreased necroptosis and reduced expression of both active and inactive forms of RIP3 and MLKL, and reduced necrosome assembly (RIP1–RIP3 complex formation) in cortical neurons, HT-29, and PC-12 cell lines. [^21]

[[ROS and necroptosis]]
Reactive oxygen species are correlated with necroptosis in various contexts, ranging from cancer to ischemia. Several studies suggest that RIPK1 promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation via NOX1 and RAC1; RIPK3, on the other hand, elevates ROS through GLUD1. Moreover, Nec-1 could decrease ROS production. Interestingly, ROS promotes RIPK1 autophosphorylation, as demonstrated by Zang et al. ROS targets cysteine S161, enhances and facilitates necrosome formation, and, as a consequence, further maintains necroptosis. What's even more fascinating: butylated hydroxyanisole–mediated decrease of reactive oxygen species does not significantly affect necroptosis initiation.[^49][^50] So, these data suggest that ROS plays a significant role in necroptosis as part of the positive loop. 



==Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of over 100 genes involved in the cellular response to ischemic brain injury, including those linked to oxidative stress and cell death. Strangely, a connection between necrotptosis and HIF1a has not been studied explicitly. Yang et al. demonstrated that inhibition of necroptosis—either by pharmacological blockade using GSK’872 or by RIPK3 knockdown with siRNA—reduces both necroptosis signaling and HIF-1α expression in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic stroke[^18]. However, direct inhibition of HIF-1α did not significantly alter necroptosis markers, suggesting that HIF-1α may act as a downstream effector rather than a primary initiator of necroptotic signaling. Interestingly, under hypoxic conditions, both HIF-1α and BNIP3 are significantly upregulated and have been shown to promote necroptosis. Additionally, p53 activation can shift the balance from BNIP3-mediated necroptosis to apoptosis by disrupting cellular acidosis and suppressing BNIP3 and HIF-1α activity[^39]. Conversely, Karshovska et al. reported that HIF-1α positively regulates necroptosis in macrophages, possibly through a shift in mitochondrial function from ATP production to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in LPS-stimulated macrophages[^41]. Furthermore, HIF-1α was shown to promote necroptosis in dermal fibroblasts, an effect that was reversed by HIF-1α inhibition[^40]. These findings suggest that HIF-1α can actively induce or sustain necroptosis under certain conditions

[[akt mTOR and necroptosis]]
==The AKT/mTOR pathway is a well-studied intracellular signaling pathway involved in regulating cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism. AKT has a long history of well-documented anti-apoptotic function. Although relatively new studies suggest that this signaling cascade plays some role during necroptosis. Min et al. indicated that traumatic brain injury induces phosphorylation of both Akt/mTOR and RIPK3/MLKL pathways. Moreover, the implementation of RIPK3 inhibitor (GSK’872) reduces Akt/mTOR activity, suggesting that RIPK3 is an upstream Akt/mTOR regulator. [^51]
Supporting the notion that RIPK3 is upstream of AKT or mTOR, AKT/mTOR inhibition did not significantly affect necrosome formation. But, reduce the cell death rate both by genetic and pharmacological AKT/mTOR inhibition. Interestingly, the combination of AKT and mTOR inhibition leads to much more significant necroptosis reduction than either one alone. In addition, during induction of necroptosis by TNF/zVAD, the authors reported increased phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR, as well as phosphorylation of direct target substrates such as GSK-3β, FOXO1, and the S6 ribosomal protein.[^52]
The Min et al.[^51] and Liu et al.[^52] groups speculated that AKT/mTOR influences necroptosis in two distinct ways—through ROS generation and apoptosis inhibition. First, FOXO1 is required for antioxidant defenses, and its degradation is directly controlled by the AKT pathway. Thus, over-activation of AKT/mTOR may reduce the cell’s antioxidant mechanisms and elevate ROS, which is an essential component for maintaining the necroptosis rate.[^52] Second, AKT inhibits caspase-8 by activating FLIPs; it is well-known that caspase-8 activity directly inhibits necrosome formation and, as a result, necroptosis execution.

==Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) is a serine-threonine protein kinase that has been shown to have a significant role in neuroinflammation and gliosis. RIPK1 can influence GSK3β through the PI3K-Akt pathway activation. Interestingly, Liu et al. showed that inhibition of p-GSK3β by SB216763 reduces the activity of the RIPK1–RIPK3–MLKL pathway and decreases LDH release and the number of PI-positive cells. This suggests that GSK3β acts upstream of necroptosis or contributes to a feedback loop that sustains it.[^27].==

[[RSK and necroptosis]]
==It has been unclear how the caspase 8 blockade of necroptosis is eliminated naturally. One of the first proposed mechanisms, suggested by Yang and colleagues[^53], involves RSK-mediated phosphorylation of caspase-8 that leads to its inactivation. The 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family of proteins is a group of highly conserved Ser/Thr kinases that regulate diverse cellular processes, such as cell growth, cell motility, cell survival, and cell proliferation. In case of caspase 8 disactivation, RSKs phosphorylate procaspase 8 at Thr265.
To prove that Thr265 phosphorylation is crucial for necroptosis,  the authors presented a series of evidence. First, they labelled phosphorylated procaspase-8 at Thr265 with antibodies and showed that phosphorylation occurs following TNFα administration and does not occur in RIP3-, MLKL-, or RIP1- knockout cells. Second, they showed that phosphorylated procaspase-8 is part of the necrosome by immunoprecipitation and noted that it lacks enzymatic activity, as measured with a commercially available caspase-8 activity kit. Third, Yang et al. introduced a mutation at the Thr265 site in embryos and found that these embryos were viable and showed no sign of necroptotic death. Overall, RSK1 deletion phenocopies RIP3 or MLKL knockout in L929 cells. 
Interestingly, RSK1 association with the necrosome occurs only after MLKL is incorporated into the complex. Moreover, recruitment of RSK1 does not require caspase-8, FADD, or RIP1, since RSK1 can be recruited to the RIP3–MLKL complex induced by artificial RIP3 dimerization.
These data were confirmed by two other research groups. He et al. also showed that phosphorylated caspase-8 in TNF-treated mice suppresses caspase-8 activity in the cecum, which promotes necroptosis.[^54]
Wang et al. demonstrated that RSK3 mediates necroptosis by regulating phosphorylation of RIP3 in rat retinal ganglion cells during OGD injury, and that interference with RSK3 activity, both genetic and pharmacological, reduces necroptosis in RGC-5 cells after ischemic injury[^55].==
 
==Triad3A, also known as RNF216, is a RING finger-containing E3 Ub ligase, and is a 2DL4 cytoplasmic binding partner. Triad3A regulates the degradation of RIPK3-interacting proteins to control necroptosis and expression of inflammatory cytokines. Triad3A inhibition accelerated cerebral I/R injury and cell death, which were largely dependent on necroptosis. In addition, Triad3A could interact with MLKL following ischemic stroke, indicating that Triad3A suppressed necroptosis through its association with MLKL[^29].==

# OGD
[[first discovers of necroptosis]]
==Although the first evidence of caspase-independent cell death with morphological features of necrosis began to be elucidated in 1988, the greatest breakthrough came in 2000 when Holler et al. discovered that receptor-interacting protein kinase plays a crucial regulatory role in this process.[^56] In the context of ischemia and necroptosis, pioneers Degterev and colleagues showed that cell death is a crucial factor in an ischemic in vivo model. Moreover, they proposed the term for this caspase-independent cell death with necrotic morphology - necroptosis. They were also the first to provide a specific receptor-interacting protein kinase inhibitor, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1).[^57] Following this research, the groups of Xu and Bruno independently began studying necroptosis in an oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro model of cortical neurons.[^42][^43]==

Data on the importance of necroptosis in ischemic-related conditions is growing day by day. Dong and Xiong showed that during acute ischemic stroke in the intensive care unit, RIPK1 and RIPK3 serum levels positively correlate with the damage volume, the severity of the disease, and the bad prognosis.[^44] Even more, the apoptosis level in postmortem human specimens increased in the core region, but not in the peri-infarct regions. On the contrary, MLKL increases both in the central and in the periphery of the lesion[^23]. 

The oxygen glucose deprivation model, the most frequently used model in ischemic in vitro studies, is commonly executed in two steps. First, the ischemic stage consists of changing the media to glucose-free and placing it in a gas chamber where oxygen is substituted with nitrogen for specific times. Immediately after the ischemic stage, cells were reperfused by removing the medium and replacing it with growth media with glucose, and cells were placed into an incubator with normoxic conditions. 

==Even though dozens of papers state that necroptosis executes cells as a consequence of oxygen-glucose deprivation, which cells predominantly undergo the cell death, and how prominent necroptosis is remains controversial.
Meloni et al. showed that necrostatin-1 exerted only a small influence on the cell-survival rate in vitro, compared with an in vivo stroke model. They suggest this is due to a lack of necroptosis in cortical neurons, while glial cells are absent or present only at a bare minimum level and therefore lack sufficient TNFα secretion to promote the necroptosis pathway[^4]. However, the authors do not provide enough data to distinguish the type of cell death, and relatively new data available at the time of the publication of Meloni’s group states that necrostatin-1, as an inhibitor of RIPK1, not only represses the necroptosis cascade but also extrinsic apoptosis. Further support for a prominent glial role comes from Fan et al.[^8], who argued that MLKL, the key executor of necroptosis in the context of spinal-cord injury, is expressed mainly in microglia and astrocytes.
On the other hand, Yang et al. demonstrated that ischemia triggers rapid, neuron-dominant necroptosis within the first 3 days. After 5 days, the predominant cell type undergoing necroptosis shifts to astrocytes[^22]. These data support the findings of Han et al., which state that pMLKL (the major executor of necroptosis) colocalizes primarily with NeuN-labeled neurons[^23].==

[[zVAD and OGD]]
==Chen et al[^58] showed that RIPK1 and the necroptosis phenotype are caused by the combined effect of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and zVAD (caspase inhibitor). Even more peculiar, treatment with oxygen-glucose deprivation alone showed greater LDH leakage than the combined OGD/zVAD treatment. These data are consistent with those provided by Feng and colleagues[^59]. Moreover, the expression of key molecules such as RIPK3, RIPK1, and both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated MLKL shows no significant difference between OGD and zVAD, and may be even more prominent in OGD[^60].==

In the context of OGD, many molecules showed neuroprotective roles by inhibition of necroptosis, including: tubacin(a specific HDAC6 inhibitor)[^9], Nec-1[^19],  RIPK1-inhibitory compound (RIC)[^10], GSK872 (a RIPK3 inhibitor)[^18], GSK840 (small-molecule inhibitor of RIPK3) [^36], SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor)[^11], baicalin (a plant-derived flavonoid)[^15], β-caryophyllene[^17], DTIO(a novel analog of Nec-1)[^19].



Evidence suggests a potential crosstalk between necroptosis and autophagy. Moreover, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of RIPK1 kinase in OGD-damaged neuronal and astrocytic cells leads to a decrease in the LC3II levels and stabilizes OGD-induced lysosomal membrane instability [^20]. Unfortunately, this information does not prove direct 


Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a multifaceted protein that plays important roles in multiple inflammatory conditions. The administration of MIF inhibitor (ISO1) and RIPK1 inhibitor (Nec-1s) can both reduce the brain EC death and neurological deficits following PIS. We conclude that myeloid-derived MIF promotes ECs' apoptosis and necroptosis through the RIPK1 kinase-dependent pathway. [^37]

[[CASP8 disactivation]]
CASP8 may be deactivated due to a lack of energy, leading to cell death, such as apoptosis through CASP3 and necroptosis through RIPK3 inactivation, if NADH and NAD have been administered. [^35]

# PANoptosis and ischemia
[^33]
Previous research has shown that different cell death pathways occur during ischemia, ranging from well-studied apoptosis to more uncommon pathways such as parthanatosis or necroptosis. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence indicates interactions among some of these pathways. In 2019, Kanneganti et al., in a condition unrelated to ischemia, suggested that specific triggers might induce multiple types of cell death (pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis) simultaneously and termed this "PANoptosis". Researchers reported that the loss of a single component is insufficient to prevent cell death. 

Although PANoptosis was discovered and studied in the context of immune responses to PAMPs, few publications explore deep interactions between cell death pathways during oxygen-glucose deprivation, without explicitly stating that it is PANoptosis. [^1] 

Gutierrez et al. verified that MLKL interacts with the NLRP3 inflammasome, which processes and activates IL-1β during necroptosis, suggesting that necroptosis is connected to other forms of cell death like pyroptosis. [^24] 

Interestingly, co-culturing OGD-damaged neurons with mesenchymal stem cells showed that the stem cells could inhibit parthanatos, necroptosis, and apoptosis by alleviating apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF).[^14] 

Additionally, although some authors state they have studied PANoptosis in certain models, distinguishing true PANoptosis (three modes in one cell) from simultaneous distinct death types in different cells is methodologically difficult. Tools to definitively prove PANoptosis, particularly in vivo or in ischemia models, are still being developed.[^2]

Hsu et al. demonstrated that oxygen-glucose deprivation in intestinal epithelial cells leads to the release of exosomal microRNAs that promote apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in neurons[^26].
