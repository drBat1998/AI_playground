Inflammation is an essential part of an organism response to the majority of injuries. Usually in the end of the response, it is beneficial to the organ, however, in the case of chronic or acute inflammation in the brain could produce more damage than the initial injury itself. 

Neuroinflammation involves neurons in response, but glial cells such as astrocytes and microglia play much more prominent role. These cells, through toll-like receptors, induce activation multiple pathways including MAPK, mTOR, and PI3K, which leads to the mobilization of a key player in inflammation - NF-kB. 

NF-kB serves as a conductor of the inflammatory orchestra, regulating immune and inflammatory response genes. Production of the "messengers" by it leads to activation of microglia and astrocytes and recruit immune cells from blood. Unfortunately activated microglia have a dual role in a brain. On one hand, they protect neurons from pathogens, but on the other hand, they can damage neurons both directly and indirectly.

Direct damage mediated by genes which live in subordination to NF-kb, such as TNFa and IL1b. They have been observed prior to neuronal death and play crucial role in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Indirect damage is caused by oxidative stress, which leads to DNA, mitochondrial and cell membrane damage in neurons. 

In sum, Nf-kb are extremely interesting pharmacological target, especially in cases of neurodegenerative diseases.
