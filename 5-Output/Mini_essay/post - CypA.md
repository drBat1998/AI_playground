Unfortunately, I cannot read a bigger paper or write a better post, due to another sleepless night gifted by the Russians. Despite that, I have found the information provided by Christofferson and Yuan useful for my research, and it may be useful for someone else. So, Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a DAMP that is released comparatively early outside the cell compared to the well-known HMGB1. Christofferson and Yuan speculated that CypA may be used as a valuable early marker of necrotic cell death, both regulated (necroptosis) and accidental (necrosis), and moreover, it is not detected in apoptotic cell death samples treated with TNFα and CHX.[1]
