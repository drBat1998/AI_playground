# Survivorship bias and Aneuploidy
Why some chromosome has more height aneuploidy rate, I heard interesting this question from my biologist friend .

First, my thoughts were the length of a chromosome is a key, maybe partially it is true. 

However, as a some sort of enlightened, I connected this problem, with the survivorship bias. We seemed to observe just children that survived, so chromosomes which are related to the most common aberration are less important. X chromosome seam to be essential, however, second and next chromosome in Kl decease are deactivated in large part.
