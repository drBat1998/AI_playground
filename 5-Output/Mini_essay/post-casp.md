You might expect fewer cells to die
That’s because CASP8’s other job is 


Caspase-8 (CASP8) sits at the crossroads of death.
When death ligands, through their receptors, activate CASP8, it cleaves downstream targets and packages the cell for tidy removal. Yet this switch is not left unguarded. A pseudo-caspase called cFLIP slots into the DISC and blunts CASP8. What is particularly interesting is that the cFLIP gene takes direct orders from NF-κB, a prosurvival and proinflammatory transcription factor.

Here’s the paradox: an inflamed microenvironment floods the nucleus with NF-κB, upscales cFLIP, and muzzles CASP8. You might expect fewer cells to die. Instead, many die louder. That’s because CASP8’s other job is to cleave RIPK1 and RIPK3, gatekeepers of necroptosis—a bombastic form of programmed necrosis in which membranes rupture and alarmins spill. The resulting release of DAMPs fans the very inflammation that first provoked NF-κB. This feedback loop explains why chronic inflammatory diseases, many fueled by persistent NF-κB activation, often show necroptotic signatures.
