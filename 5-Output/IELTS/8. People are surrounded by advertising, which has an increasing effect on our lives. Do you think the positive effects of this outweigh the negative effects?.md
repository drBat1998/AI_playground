Could you explain my mistakes?

Certainly, here are the explanations for the mistakes I found in your text:

1.  "Fool" should be "full": "Time Square and Akihabara, which are associated with 21st world, are full of bright and attractive ads."
2.  "Привабливих" should be "attractive": "Time Square and Akihabara, which are associated with 21st world, are full of bright and attractive ads."
3.  "Negative" needs an article before it: "In my opinion, advertising has a negative impact on humanity."
4.  "Distracted" needs to be in the past tense: "Drivers are constantly distracted by the ads near roads, which create dangerous situations."
5.  "One's" should be replaced with "their": "In addition, everyone has been distracted by the ads during one's favourite football match or TV show."
6.  "Promote" should be in the present tense: "Ads promote political parties and views."
7.  "Anourmous" should be "enormous": "During Black Friday many people buy an enormous amount of things they don't need."
8.  "Despite its positive impact on the economy" should be added at the beginning of the last sentence: "To conclude, despite its positive impact on the economy, advertising has great disadvantages."
