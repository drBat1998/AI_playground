##### Outline
Intro
Constant debate between ecoactivists and fighters with poverty in a field about what is more important reducing environmental changes or stopping poverty. 
Thesis - I believe that reducing poverty through economic development not only does not damage the environment but improves it.
Body 1
A big body of evidence supports the notion that developed country has a much lower level of poverty. In addition, the poverty is not as devastating as in developing one. Low income in countries like Germany or Sweden is associated with social benefits and support from their government and non-profit organisations, on the contrary, even inside European Union, poor people from Slovakia have less support.
Body 2
It is also irrefutable that manufacture of any complex item is connected with the pollution of the local microenvironment. Most of energy we use in all-day life causes damage to the Earth to some extent. However, it is also undebatable that rich countries have much more ability to change them to more ecology-friendly ones.

I'll evaluate the essay based on the provided prompt and content. Here's my assessment:

**Relevance to the Prompt (8/10):**

- The essay addresses the prompt effectively by discussing the debate between environmental activists and poverty alleviation proponents. It takes a clear stance that reducing poverty through economic development can improve the environment.

**Thesis Statement (7/10):**

- The thesis statement is clear but could be more specific in outlining the main points the essay will discuss. A more precise preview of the arguments would provide a stronger roadmap for the reader.

**Arguments (7/10):**

- The essay presents two main arguments: the correlation between developed countries and lower poverty rates and the potential for rich countries to transition to more environmentally friendly practices.
- While these arguments are reasonable, they could benefit from more evidence and examples to support the claims. The essay touches on the idea of poverty and social benefits but lacks concrete data or real-world examples.
- Additionally, the second argument about the transition to eco-friendly practices could be expanded upon with specific examples of policies or initiatives in developed countries.

**Organization (7/10):**

- The essay has a basic structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.
- However, the organization could be improved by using clear topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to enhance the overall structure and readability.

**Coherence (6/10):**

- The essay's ideas are somewhat disjointed, and there is a need for smoother transitions between paragraphs.
- Additionally, more connecting sentences are needed to improve the overall coherence and flow of the essay.

**Logic (7/10):**

- The arguments are logical, but they would benefit from more depth and evidence to support the claims.
- The essay should also consider and address potential counterarguments to provide a more balanced perspective.

**Language (8/10):**

- The language is generally clear and free from major grammatical errors.
- The vocabulary and style are adequate, but some sentences could be more concise for improved clarity.

Overall Grade: 7/10

**Improved Version:** The ongoing debate between environmental activists and poverty alleviation advocates centers on the question of whether it's more critical to mitigate environmental changes or combat poverty. My contention is that reducing poverty through economic development not only fails to harm the environment but can actually enhance it.

**Body 1:** Substantial evidence supports the argument that developed countries exhibit lower poverty rates compared to their developing counterparts. Moreover, poverty in developed nations is generally less devastating, partly because low-income individuals in countries like Germany or Sweden often benefit from extensive social support systems provided by their governments and non-profit organizations. In contrast, within the European Union itself, those living in poverty in countries like Slovakia have access to fewer resources and support mechanisms.

**Body 2:** While it's undeniable that the manufacturing of complex products is associated with local environmental pollution, it's also a fact that most forms of energy consumption in our daily lives have some environmental impact. Nevertheless, it's equally indisputable that economically affluent nations possess greater resources and capabilities to transition toward more eco-friendly practices. They have the means to invest in renewable energy sources, implement stricter environmental regulations, and develop technologies that minimize pollution.

In conclusion, the reduction of poverty through economic development need not harm the environment; in fact, it has the potential to lead to improvements in environmental practices. Rich countries, with their greater capacity to adapt and change, can play a crucial role in fostering a more sustainable future for both humanity and the planet.
