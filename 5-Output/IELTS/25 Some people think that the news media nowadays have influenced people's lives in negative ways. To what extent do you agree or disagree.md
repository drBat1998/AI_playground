First deteriorate impact of media on our conceptions about politicians, culture, traditions, and views on life in general.

Furthermore, The paparazzi in pursuit of latest and most hype news could damage private life and carrier of famous and influential persons. Sometimes the hot news is not even true at all, that damages reputation of those influencers which can be difficult to return to the previous state.
On the other hand, news media provides quite fast a large portion of the population with useful information about emergency situations such as an earthquake or war. This pressure information gives a chance of surviving in those situations. In addition, if a citizen uses news from different sources and polishes them with his critical thinking the opinion gives a good background to choose write candidate on the elections.
In conclusion, despite the fact that the news media have a good amount of positive influence, nowadays the downsides of media have more impacts in my opinion. 
##### GPT correction
**Introduction:** "I partially agree with the given statement. I believe that news providers impact lives of millions in a largely negative way."

Explanation: The introduction is clear and concise. You express that you have a partial agreement with the given statement, which is an effective way to introduce your argument. You assert that news providers have a largely negative impact on people's lives. There are no significant mistakes in this part.

**First Body Paragraph:** "First deteriorate impact of media on our conceptions about politicians, culture, traditions, and views on life in general. Nowadays it is difficult to say if the thoughts about key events are ours or put in our heads by the media. In addition, platforms where people usually consume news cut unpleasant information from sources that people are used to hate. This leads to narrowing perspective and gives an easy way to propaganda."

Explanation:

1. "First deteriorate impact of media on our conceptions about politicians, culture, traditions, and views on life in general."
    
    - The phrase "First deteriorate impact" is not grammatically correct. It should be "First, the deteriorating impact" or "First, the negative impact."
    - The sentence should be rephrased for clarity, such as "First, the media negatively influences our conceptions about politicians, culture, traditions, and life in general."
2. "Nowadays it is difficult to say if the thoughts about key events are ours or put in our heads by the media."
    
    - The word "about" should be replaced with "regarding" or "concerning" for better sentence structure.
    - The word "ours" should be replaced with "our own."
3. "In addition, platforms where people usually consume news cut unpleasant information from sources that people are used to hate."
    
    - The word "cut" is not the correct word here. It seems you meant to say "omit" or "exclude."
    - The phrase "that people are used to hate" is not clear. It might be better to say "that people find disagreeable" or "that people dislike."
4. "This leads to narrowing perspective and gives an easy way to propaganda."
    
    - The phrase "narrowing perspective" should be "a narrowed perspective."
    - "Gives an easy way to propaganda" should be "provides an easy way for propaganda to influence."

**Second Body Paragraph:** "Furthermore, The paparazzi in pursuit of latest and most hype news could damage private life and carrier of famous and influential persons. Sometimes the hot news is not even true at all, that damages reputation of those influencers which can be difficult to return to the previous state."

Explanation:

1. "Furthermore, The paparazzi in pursuit of latest and most hype news could damage private life and carrier of famous and influential persons."
    
    - The word "carrier" should be "career."
    - The phrase "in pursuit of latest and most hype news" could be improved to "in pursuit of the latest and most sensational news."
2. "Sometimes the hot news is not even true at all, that damages reputation of those influencers which can be difficult to return to the previous state."
    
    - The phrase "hot news" could be replaced with "sensational news."
    - "That damages reputation of those influencers" should be "which damages the reputation of these influencers."
    - "Which can be difficult to return to the previous state" is not clear. It might be better to say "which can be challenging to recover from."

**Third Body Paragraph:** "On the other hand, news media provides quite fast a large portion of the population with useful information about emergency situations such as an earthquake or war. This pressure information gives a chance of surviving in those situations. In addition, if a citizen uses news from different sources and polishes them with his critical thinking the opinion gives a good background to choose write candidate on the elections."

Explanation:

1. "On the other hand, news media provides quite fast a large portion of the population with useful information about emergency situations such as an earthquake or war."
    
    - "Provides quite fast" should be "provides information rapidly."
    - "A large portion of the population" can be simplified to "many people."
2. "This pressure information gives a chance of surviving in those situations."
    
    - It seems that you meant "precise information" instead of "pressure information."
3. "In addition, if a citizen uses news from different sources and polishes them with his critical thinking the opinion gives a good background to choose write candidate on the elections."
    
    - "Polishes them with his critical thinking the opinion" is not clear. It might be better to say "analyzes the news with critical thinking, it provides a solid foundation for choosing the right candidate in the elections."
    - "Write candidate" should be "the right candidate."

**Conclusion:** "In conclusion, despite the fact that the news media have a good amount of positive influence, nowadays the downsides of media have more impacts in my opinion."

Explanation:

1. "In conclusion, despite the fact that the news media have a good amount of positive influence..."
    
    - The word "the" before "news media" is unnecessary.
2. "...nowadays the downsides of media have more impacts in my opinion."
    
    - "More impacts" should be "a greater impact" for better phrasing.
