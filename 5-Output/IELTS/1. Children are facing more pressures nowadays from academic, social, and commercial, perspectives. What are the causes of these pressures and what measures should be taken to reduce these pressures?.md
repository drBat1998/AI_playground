**Introduction:**

The introduction effectively uses a metaphor of the Earth becoming smaller, symbolizing the increasing pressure in our world. It mentions that this pressure is experienced by people of all ages, with a particular emphasis on children. The thesis statement is clear and concise, stating that globalism exerts extreme pressure on children, and the essay argues that instead of reducing it, we should control and guide it.

**Body Paragraph 1:**

- **Problem:** The body paragraph highlights the problem of the Internet and academic competition creating pressure for students worldwide. This is a relevant issue in the context of globalization.
    
- **Solutions:** The solutions proposed are clear, but there are a few points to consider:
    
    - The phrase "It is childish to think that if we cut some pressure down it would be better for our future generation" might be rephrased for clarity. Perhaps, "Simplifying the situation by merely reducing pressure is an overly simplistic approach and may not benefit our future generations."
        
    - The sentence, "Quiet opposite they will be no match to a person who came from a developing country, which has been left in an even more difficult situation," could be clearer. You might consider rephrasing it to something like, "On the contrary, they may find themselves at a disadvantage compared to individuals from developing countries who have faced even greater challenges."
        
    - The last part, "we could use money and opportunities to provide our children with a sophisticated education and all the necessary stuff to accomplish it," provides a clear solution. However, it might be beneficial to expand on how "money and opportunities" can be harnessed to provide a sophisticated education and what this entails.
        

Overall, your introduction and the first body paragraph set up the problem and proposed solutions effectively. Just consider some minor phrasing improvements for greater clarity.
