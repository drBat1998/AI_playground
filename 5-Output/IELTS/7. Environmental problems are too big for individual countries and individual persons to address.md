##### GPT correction
Certainly, let's review your essay for additional mistakes and provide suggestions for improvement:

**1.** "Environmental problems are affecting everyone on the Earth, from personal level through corporations to countries, and organisations."

**Mistake:** The sentence is grammatically correct, but it can be improved for clarity and conciseness.

**Revised:** "Environmental problems affect everyone on Earth, from individuals to corporations, countries, and organizations."

**2.** "Humanity would not move anyway in resolving the climate issue if only Western countries would do the right things.States such as China, Russia and Iran will not do anything if sanctions and restrictions do not apply to them otherwise."

**Mistakes:**

- The sentence lacks proper punctuation.
- "Anyway" should be "anywhere."
- Consider a more specific phrase than "do the right things" for clarity.

**Revised:** "Humanity would not make progress in resolving the climate issue if only Western countries take action. States such as China, Russia, and Iran are unlikely to take steps unless sanctions and restrictions are imposed."

**3.** "In addition, businesses which do not want to follow ecological laws could just move to undeveloped countries which don't have ones."

**Mistake:** "Undeveloped" should be "underdeveloped," and consider using "that lack them" for clarity.

**Revised:** "Additionally, businesses that do not wish to comply with ecological laws could simply relocate to underdeveloped countries that lack such laws."

**4.** "To resolve climate change, the best possible plan should be applied. Scientific knowledge and abilities from the majority of nations should be used to create logical and efficient steps in that way."

**Mistake:** The phrase "in that way" is somewhat vague. Consider specifying the steps.

**Revised:** "To address climate change, the best possible plan should be implemented. Scientific knowledge and abilities from the majority of nations should be used to create logical and efficient strategies."

**5.** "For sure, individual steps are also useful and would help solve some aspects of the problem. However, even in this case, laws from local or national governments would have the more prominent effect because it will be not an option to do the good thing, but an obligation and crime to do otherwise."

**Mistake:** The phrase "it will be not an option" should be "it will not be an option." Also, consider rephrasing the sentence for clarity.

**Revised:** "Certainly, individual efforts are also valuable and would contribute to solving specific aspects of the problem. However, even in this scenario, laws enacted by local or national governments would have a more significant impact because it would not be a matter of choice to act responsibly but a legal obligation, with violations considered as crimes."

Overall, your essay is well-written, and the suggested improvements are mainly minor grammatical and phrasing adjustments for enhanced clarity and flow. These revisions should help make your essay even more polished.
