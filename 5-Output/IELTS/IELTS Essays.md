Summing up, anti-social behaviour and lack of respect can be edited by censorship of some content, and better education for children. 

Here is a corrected version of your text with explanations of the changes:

Anti-social behavior is quite common in the Internet era. This essay intends to analyze the key causes of this modern phenomenon and suggests some ways to ameliorate the behavior.

Confidentiality on the Internet leads to harassment due to anonymity. In our day, it is easy to leave bad comments below some YouTube videos or tweets. The solution to this could be to raise awareness that the person who wrote the comment psychologically damages the creator of the content.

The popularization of anti-social behavior in social media, films, and TV shows is another factor. The bad guy is constantly shown as extremely cool and popular, which leads to the imitation of such behavior by younger audiences. Censorship should be used to regulate this type of character.

In conclusion, anti-social behavior and lack of respect can be addressed by censoring some content and providing better education for children.

Could you explain my mistakes

Certainly! Here are some of the mistakes and corrections in your text:

1.  "ненаказуємість" - This appears to be a word in Ukrainian, but it doesn't have a direct equivalent in English. I assume you meant "anonymity," which refers to the fact that people can hide their identity when they post comments online.
    
2.  "leads to harassment through" - It's not clear what you mean by "through" in this context. I changed it to "due to," which is a more common phrase that means "because of."
    
3.  "aware that the person who wrote the comment psychologically damaged the creator" - This sentence is unclear and needs to be rephrased. I assumed you meant something like "raise awareness that leaving hurtful comments can have a negative impact on the person who created the content."
    
4.  "imitation of one's behaviour by the youngest" - I assume you meant "imitation of such behavior by younger people." "One's behavior" sounds a bit vague, whereas "such behavior" refers back to the idea of anti-social behavior that you mentioned earlier.
    
5.  "Censure should be used" - In English, "censure" typically refers to a formal reprimand or condemnation. I assume you meant something like "regulate" or "control." I changed it to "censorship should be used to regulate this type of character."
    

Overall, your text had some minor grammar and spelling errors, but the main issues were with clarity and word choice. I hope this explanation helps!

Conclusion

Recruitment of new reliable staff is essential for small and big business. The modern world gives a vast amount of possible recruitment methods, such as tests, exams, and interviews. I disagree with the statement that an interview is not an efficient method.

Firstly, Interviewing gives the possibility to check trustworthy of a candidate. In our time is extremely easy to cheat on the test or on the easement. However, When the talk is personalised it is relatively impossible to take information otherwise as a brain.

Secondly, Interviewing provides interviewer with information about the candidate which is impossible to have by other methods. A skilled interviewer could evaluate the interests, hobbies, desires, and ambitions of the future employee. In addition, verbal and oratory skills could be estimated if the job needs such skills. 

-   "Recruitment of new reliable staff is essential for small and big business." - This sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved by adding an article before "reliable staff." For example: "Recruitment of new, reliable staff is essential for small and big businesses."
    
-   "The modern world gives a vast amount of possible recruitment methods" - "Vast amount" is usually used for uncountable nouns, like water or air. In this case, you're talking about recruitment methods, which are countable, so it would be better to say "The modern world offers a variety of recruitment methods."
    
-   "I disagree with the statement that an interview is not an efficient method." - This sentence is grammatically correct, but it would be more natural to say "I disagree with the statement that interviews are not an efficient method."
    
-   "However, When the talk is personalised it is relatively impossible to take information otherwise as a brain." - This sentence is a bit unclear. It might be better to rephrase it as something like: "However, during a personalized interview, it is much more difficult for a candidate to deceive the interviewer or provide false information."
    
-   "Secondly, Interviewing provides interviewer with information about the candidate which is impossible to have by other methods." - This sentence is grammatically correct, but it would be more natural to say "Secondly, interviewing provides the interviewer with information about the candidate that is impossible to obtain through other methods."
    
-   "A skilled interviewer could evaluate the interests, hobbies, desires, and ambitions of the future employee." - This sentence is grammatically correct, but it might be more natural to say "A skilled interviewer can assess a candidate's interests, hobbies, goals, and ambitions."

Conclusion

In the marketing era, It is crucial to have attention from the young age audience. Fast food companies and big supermarkets supply schools with funds in exchange for popularity. The school and students could take advantage from the money provided by restaurants and supermarkets.

To begin with, fast food is a part of the life of modern students, therefore giving use to computation between different restaurants is beneficial. As it is, children consume extreme amounts of fast food advertisements from films, Tv shows, and social media. And competitivity in the field is enormous, so funds from this competition could be used to buy expensive textbooks for the library and improve science or sports facilities.

In the era of marketing, it is crucial to capture the attention of a young audience. Fast food companies and big supermarkets often supply schools with funds in exchange for publicity. Schools and students can benefit from the money provided by these restaurants and supermarkets.

To begin with, fast food is a part of modern students' lives, so promoting competition between different restaurants can be beneficial. Children are exposed to excessive amounts of fast food advertisements through films, TV shows, and social media, and competition in the industry is fierce. Therefore, funds from this competition could be used to purchase expensive textbooks for the library and improve science or sports facilities.

In today's marketing-driven world, capturing the attention of a young audience is essential for fast food companies and big supermarkets. To achieve this, they often provide schools with funding in exchange for increased visibility and popularity. While some argue that this arrangement can be beneficial for both parties, others believe that it has negative consequences.

On the one hand, having access to additional funds can help schools improve their facilities and resources. For example, they could use the money to purchase new textbooks, invest in science and sports equipment, or provide additional support for students in need. Moreover, children are already exposed to fast food advertisements through various media channels, so allowing these companies to compete for visibility in schools might not make much of a difference in terms of their overall exposure.

On the other hand, critics argue that promoting fast food and unhealthy eating habits among children is irresponsible and can lead to negative health outcomes in the long run. Additionally, allowing corporations to market to young audiences in schools raises concerns about the commercialization of education and the ethics of such arrangements.

In conclusion, while the practice of allowing fast food companies and big supermarkets to provide funding to schools can have some benefits, it also raises important ethical and health concerns. Therefore, it is important for schools and policymakers to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of such arrangements before entering into them.
#### 12. Young people know about international pop and movie stars but know less about famous historical people. Reason and Solution.

Type: Problem solution

emphasize, "irrefutably" should be "undoubtedly."


Outline:
Intro:
	Background Knowing the past is key to the future. Unfortunately, modern people and specifically young ones prefer to know about celebrities than great people from the past. Justin Biber or Tom Cruse are irrefutably better known than heroes of wars, writers, scientists, or poets from previous centuries. 
	Thesis - This problem and possible solutions shall be discussed in this essay. 
Reasons 

The first reason for the celebrity's population is social media, in contrast to historical figures young people can not follow them and take some sort of interaction. In addition, modern culture propagates different values, therefore the youth of today have trouble understanding bravery and sacrifice which was virtues of the past. 
	
Moreover, nowadays education system is based on checking facts and has little interest in stories, which was more important than dates or locations. The greatest example is Virgil's Aeneid. 


Solutions
There are many ways to change this trend. First of all, it is the popularisation of historically important persons in films, tv shows, music, and social media. The growing popularity of Sabaton band which sings about historical events shows a desire for knowledge and interest in the topic from young people. Secondly, move accent from date to personalities in history classes. For example, historical YouTube channels have millions of subscribers mainly because they enphercise essentials of a context and personality in historical events.

Conclusion
To conclude, there are several innovative and creative methods that can be used to make the youth more interested and aware about the notable people from history.

2.  "irrefutably" should be "undoubtedly."

	Example

Families are important components of society in every country. In the waste majority of them, women and men have a specific role. Reasons for these "roles" are based on biological and cultural-historical causes and are going to change in the future.
Firstly, Men and women have specific biological features, such as differences in physical and mental scale. In addition, a human child is vulnerable to external influence for a long period of time. This leads to separation of roles in which mother should protect children and father find some food to eat.
Thought of ages a great portion of families were divided in a specific manner due to religious and traditional influence. Every culte or religion has an explanation of why and how this separation should occur and maintain. For example, In the Bible, this issue was described in multiple chapters in both the Old and New Testaments.
However, in the future, the scenario will change. The money is essential in the 21st century and for sure continues to be, so both parents should work to maintain a good quality of life.

-   "Waste majority" should be "vast majority".
-   Instead of "scale", you may want to use "differences in physical and mental attributes".
-   "This leads to separation of roles in which mother should protect children and father find some food to eat" can be improved. You can rephrase it as "This has led to traditional gender roles in which women are expected to care for children and men are expected to provide for the family."
-   "Thought of ages" should be "Throughout history" or "Over time".
-   "Culte" should be "culture".
-   "This issue was described in multiple chapters" can be improved by specifying what issue you are referring to. For example, "The gender roles within families were described in multiple chapters".
-   "However, in the future, the scenario will change" is a bit abrupt. You can use a transitional phrase such as "Nevertheless" or "Despite these historical reasons" to better connect your ideas.
-   Instead of "The money is essential in the 21st century and for sure continues to be", you can rephrase it as "In the 21st century, financial stability is important and will likely continue to be so. As a result, both parents often need to work to maintain a good quality of life."

#### 16. If children behave badly should their parents take responsibility and also be punished? State your opinion.

	Example
Conclusion

It is a constant debate do parents should be held responsible for their children's crimes, and what age children should be to take responsibility for themselves. I believe that parents held full responsibility if their children commit any crime. 
The children can not completely understand crime and the morality of society. Even adults are not always aware of crimes that they commit due to a lack of knowledge when they are visiting nowel country for them. Therefore, Parents must teach their offspring to live in this complex world.
Unfortunately, the biology of young persons usually promotes bad behaviour and selfishness. Human children are extremely vulnerable for a long time, contrary to animals like lions or bats. 

There are a few mistakes in the passage:

1.  The first sentence is incomplete and needs to be revised for clarity.
2.  In the second sentence, "do" should be changed to "whether".
3.  The statement "Even adults are not always aware of crimes that they commit due to a lack of knowledge when they are visiting nowel country for them" is unclear and needs to be revised for clarity.
4.  The sentence "Therefore, Parents must teach their offspring to live in this complex world" could be improved by adding more details to support the argument.
    
5.  The sentence "Unfortunately, the biology of young persons usually promotes bad behaviour and selfishness" is a broad generalization and lacks evidence to support the claim.

Here's an edited version of the passage:

The question of whether parents should be held responsible for their children's crimes and at what age children should take responsibility for themselves is a constant debate. In my opinion, parents should be held fully responsible if their children commit any crime because children may not fully understand the morality of society. It is the responsibility of parents to teach their children to live in this complex world and to be aware of the consequences of their actions.

Moreover, children are biologically vulnerable for a long time and may be more likely to exhibit bad behavior and selfishness. However, it is important to note that not all children exhibit these tendencies and individual factors such as upbringing, environment, and mental health should also be taken into account. Ultimately, it is important for parents to instill good values in their children from a young age and to take responsibility for their actions if they do commit a crime.

Introduction
Background - It is undeniable that a college education has many advantages, especially face-to-face communication with the professors, academic atmosphere, and other useful participation on campus. 
Thesis - However, I disagree that distant-learning programs can not provide beneficial education.
Body 1
	Distant learning gives more flexibility and freedom of movement. Students have the ability to choose a time of day when they want to hear a lecture.  
Body 2
	A student could combine theoretical knowledge with working experience. Combination of these approaches could be extremely useful in the case of IT specialisations when mistakes and problems from work provide questions for professors and interest in specific lectures.
Body 3
	Distant learning provides the best of the best courses from the most prestigious universities. When you live in a third-world country like Ukraine, it is a spectacular feeling to have the ability to hear Harward lectures; like Harward CS50 course.
Conclusion

There are a few minor mistakes in your essay, which I will explain below:

1.  In the thesis statement, the word "beneficial" is missing. You should say, "However, I disagree that distant-learning programs cannot provide beneficial education."
    
2.  In the first sentence of Body 1, the word "hear" should be replaced with "watch." You should say, "Students have the ability to choose a time of day when they want to watch a lecture."
    
3.  In Body 2, the phrase "in the case of IT specialisations" should be changed to "in the case of IT specializations."
    
4.  In Body 2, the sentence "Combination of these approaches could be extremely useful in the case of IT specializations when mistakes and problems from work provide questions for professors and interest in specific lectures" is unclear. It would be better to rephrase it to something like: "Combining theoretical knowledge with working experience can be especially useful for IT students, as they can apply their work problems to class discussions and gain a deeper understanding of the material."

#### 19. Government should fund sport and art for school students, rather than professional sports, arts events. Agree or disagree?

Introduction
	Background - Government collects taxes to function by itself and provides useful opportunities to citizens. Sports and art in the professional league could and should be able to collect finance from other sources, on the contrary sport and cultural events at school do not have any other option to ask for funds from local or central budgets.
	Thesis - I agree that most of the funds should be allocated forwards schools, so I provide arguments supporting my opinion. 
Body 1
Sports at school encourage students to be healthier. The vast majority of scientific papers emphasize importance of movement, especially at our time when children are used to play more computer games than tennis or football. 
Body 2
In addition, Art classes provide useful information about famous painters and architects which is essential for a broad overview and відчуття прекрасного. To improve доступність of arts between poor families government should finance free instruments for painting and architecture classes. 
Body 3
Finally, both sports and cultural events need money for travelling to other schools and countries. It provides close boundaries between students all around the world.
Conclusion
In summary, It is way better to spend money on our future generation than on events which are mainly used for propaganda.

There are several mistakes in your essay:

1.  The use of "forwards" in the thesis statement is incorrect. It should be "towards."
2.  In Body 1, the sentence "The vast majority of scientific papers emphasize importance of movement, especially at our time when children are used to play more computer games than tennis or football" is unclear and could benefit from rephrasing for clarity.
3.  In Body 2, the sentence "To improve доступність of arts between poor families government should finance free instruments for painting and architecture classes" is grammatically incorrect and should be rephrased. Additionally, the use of a non-English word ("доступність") may be confusing for readers who do not understand the language.
4.  In the conclusion, the phrase "way better" is informal and should be replaced with a more formal phrase. Additionally, the sentence "than on events which are mainly used for propaganda" is unclear and could be rephrased for clarity.

Here is a possible revised version:

Introduction Background - The government collects taxes to function and provide useful opportunities to citizens, including support for sports and arts programs. While professional leagues can collect finance from other sources, schools often rely on local or central budgets to fund sports and cultural events. Thesis - I agree that most of the funds should be allocated towards schools, and I will provide arguments supporting my opinion.

Body 1 Sports programs at schools encourage students to lead healthier lifestyles. Numerous scientific studies have emphasized the importance of physical activity, especially given the prevalence of sedentary behaviors such as computer gaming among children. By funding sports programs at schools, the government can promote physical fitness and overall health among students.

Body 2 Art classes provide valuable opportunities for students to learn about famous artists and architects, which is essential for developing a sense of aesthetics. To ensure that arts education is accessible to low-income families, the government could consider financing free art supplies for painting and architecture classes. This would help to level the playing field and ensure that all students have access to high-quality arts education.

Body 3 Funding for sports and cultural events at schools can also facilitate cultural exchange and promote global understanding. By providing resources for students to travel to other schools and countries, the government can help to create connections between students from different backgrounds and promote mutual understanding.

Conclusion In summary, I believe that allocating funds towards schools is a wise investment in our future generation. By promoting physical fitness, arts education, and cultural exchange, we can help to foster well-rounded and globally aware citizens.

Conclusion

There are a few mistakes in this essay. Here are some suggested corrections:

Introduction:

-   The thesis statement could be more specific and clear. Instead of saying "the advantages of the machination of different types of work are overwhelming the disadvantages," try to state your argument more directly. For example, "I believe that the benefits of using machines in various industries outweigh the drawbacks."

Body 1:

-   The example given is not related to the stated sentence. The sentence mentions "work that humans cannot accomplish due to biological limits," but the example provided is about construction of semiconductors, which is not related to biology. Consider revising the sentence and providing a more relevant example.

Body 2:

-   "Automatizaide" should be spelled "automated."
-   The sentence structure is a bit awkward. Consider revising it to be more clear and concise. For example, "Automated machines in agriculture have increased productivity and reduced the amount of manual labor required."

Body 3:

-   The first sentence could be more specific. Instead of saying "machines reduce the need for manual work," try to provide a more concrete example or explanation.
-   The sentence "technical failure can disturb the whole working system and lead to losses" is incomplete. You could add more detail or explanation to this sentence.

Overall, try to be more specific and provide more relevant examples to support your arguments. Make sure your sentences are clear and concise, and proofread for spelling and grammar errors.

Thesis - This essay will discuss the influence of economic development on citizens of countries with different levels of development. Body 1 State sentences - For the poor and less developed world it gives their population outstanding abilities in fields of education, medicine, and comfortability of life in general. Example - For a long period of time China was a quite poor country and their labour crafted goods for extremely low prices by their own hands. On the contrary, today they have the biggest count of the middle class in the whole world, which makes China an extremely valuable market for investments and selling goods. Students from Asia constitute a big part of most prestigious universities. Needless to say, for them growth in the economy is extremely positive development. Body 2 State sentences - In the case of rich and well-developed countries the growth of backyards country is not so good. Example - For them well-educated workers from developing countries create stiff competition, due to good education and qualification with much less salary. Worse still, some work could be given to outsourcing to the developing world for a small price. As a result, citizens from the rich countries are more unhappy with the economic growth.

There are a few mistakes in the essay:

1.  The first sentence in the introduction is not grammatically correct. It could be rephrased as "In the past centuries, the world's economy has grown constantly."
    
2.  The thesis statement could be more specific. Instead of just saying the essay will discuss the influence of economic development on citizens of countries with different levels of development, it could state which specific aspects of economic development will be discussed.
    
3.  In Body 1, the sentence "This growth induces different positive and negative outcomes for humanity" is too general and doesn't provide specific information about the positive outcomes.
    
4.  In the second example in Body 1, the phrase "biggest count of the middle class" should be "largest middle-class population."
    
5.  In Body 2, the sentence "In the case of rich and well-developed countries the growth of backyards country is not so good" is not clear and could be rephrased to better convey the intended meaning.
    
6.  The sentence "Worse still, some work could be given to outsourcing to the developing world for a small price" in Body 2 is missing a word and could be rephrased to be clearer.

#### 23. Get rid of old things to get the newest fashion and the latest technology. Do the disadvantages of a throwaway society outweigh advantages?

Words: irrefutable, consumerism, 

Spelling: overthrow, irrefutable, outstrip, consumerism, billions, quantities, fulfil, arrived, Rivals, extreme

Outline
Introduction
It is irrefutable that societies all around the globe are at one point or another affected by use-and-through culture. I believe that the advantages are outweighed the disadvantages. 
Part 1
On the positive side, consumerism gives billions of jobs. To manufacture goods in such quantities to provide them with the best price possible companies constantly increase the employment rate in poor countries. In addition, in response to consumer demand, more companies arrived in the global market to fulfil that demand and increase competition between them.
Part 2
Furthermore, constant competition between gigantic corporations and small businesses for consumers gives money for research and development. Rivals such as Apple and Samsung, or Hyundai and BMW are created a lot of good products and  
Part 3
On the downside, extreme consumerism leads
Conclusion
To conclude, I believe that demand from people pushes the economy and technology forward despite disadvantages such as rubbish, over-working

#### 24. Once children start school, teachers have more influence than parents on their intellectual and social development. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Words: 
get admission - 
quality time - 
children - synonyms
Spelling: 
variety
shrink
choices
gradually
behaviour
contrary
knowledge
immeasurable

Children absorb information from a variety of sources, and some bloggers from YouTube now a day could influence them even more than teachers or parents. If we shrink to two choices, teacher or parent, I will argue that parents impact gradually more than teachers on child behaviour and intelligence. 

Firstly, a teacher is a new person for the child, on the contrary parents are present in their life constantly. Although teachers provide them with new knowledge, but parents could cut or add classes which they think are better for their children. In this way, their impact is immeasurable, due to their influence not on information, but on the vector of development itself. 

Secondly, behaviour of parents plays a role model for their children. Teacher's behaviour influence communication between a person and "a boss", on other hand parents' behaviour shows model in a bigger variety of cases, such as a person with loved ones, a person with a friend, and a person with society in general. 

Thus, I believe even after a child gets admission to the school, parents still play a prominent role in their life.
