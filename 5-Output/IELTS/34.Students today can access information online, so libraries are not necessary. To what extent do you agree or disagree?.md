For centuries a library was the only place where you could find knowledge about the world. From Alexandria's library to the library of a modern university, the place was a location where you could study with pieces and focus on a subject of interest or necessity. This time has changed due to the invention of the Internet, so question has arrived do we actually need them? I will argue for features of a library which we still need from them. 

In the first place, access to books which otherwise cost a fortune is deadly essential. Although many would say that you can download them for free from the Internet, a big portion of the newest scientific discoveries can be accessed only through subscriptions or libraries. 

In addition, libraries are quiet and beautiful places created by architecture to induce learning experience. They create a unique magical aesthetic which motivated students for centuries, majority of successful students prefer a library as a place of choice to prepare for the assignment of exams. 

In sum, for sure a library will never ever play such a prominent role in human lives, as it was previously. However, the benefits clearly demonstrate the library should still be maintained.
