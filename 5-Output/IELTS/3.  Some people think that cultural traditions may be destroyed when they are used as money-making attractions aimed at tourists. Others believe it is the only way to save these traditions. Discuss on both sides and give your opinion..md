##### Essay
Have you heard anything about German bear or Greek theatre? Two polar points of view exist, cultural traditions damaged or saved by tourists. Despite changes which they do to traditions, I think that tourists are the most efficient method to maintaining culture and tradition alive.

Tourists and industries around them change traditional culture. Ukrainian cossacks never dressed as the modern films and pictures show us, but mass production creates popular pictures of them which are well known at a great distance from my country.

Money from tourism gives purpose to maintain culture, especially in less developing countries. For Turkey or Thailand income from the tourist business is crucial and industries of the countries, such as food, hotels, and transport, depend on tourists' money. Unique culture is not the last cause of the popularity of this country as a tourist destination. 

Culture and tradition if they become popular increase the prestige of a nation. KPOP and Turkish TV shows induce influence of their motherland country in the world. Russian writers and ballets create a more pleasant picture of Russia than it is in real life.
