Introduction
Computer games are the fastest growing industry at this period of time, it is only a matter of time before we can enter the virtual world. So the influence of the games on humanity as a special young part of it is a big concern. The video games have a lot of pros and cons, but in my opinion, the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, to illustrate I chose three categories such as social interaction, behaviour and education influence.
Body 1 - Social aspects
From one perspective, gaming provokes loneliness in the young generation, and to some extent it is true. Japanese otaku could clearly show that; however, from the other point of view, they have some virtual friends which could be difficult for them to obtain in real life. 
Body 2 - Behaviour influence
It is quite a debatable issue, what influences games, special violent ones, have on children.  The growing body of evidence supports that violent characters could provoke aggressive behaviour in gamers. However, I support the notion that brutal games have some sort of therapeutic effects after bullying in schools, universities and offices.
Body 3 - Education
Games play a dual role in education as well. Some games provide practice in problem-solving and logical thinking, as well as knowledge in history or biology. In addition, they could push children forward to learn computer science and programming, although they could reduce focus from school education and reading, which are less fun activities to do.
