Overall Grade: 8/10

**Improved Version:** The enduring debate between genetic factors and environmental factors as determinants of success spans various domains, including art, science, and even everyday skills like driving. In my perspective, individuals in the realm of art should possess a blend of both factors.

On one hand, practice is an undeniable linchpin in mastering any field, including art. Art classes and schools equip individuals with the ability to replicate the finest works of renowned artists like Da Vinci or van Gogh. Moreover, an untrained eye typically struggles to distinguish between original masterpieces and meticulously crafted copies.

Conversely, predisposition and creative ability distinguish an ordinary hard worker from a genius. While science and philosophy offer numerous examples, it's in fields that heavily utilize creative prowess where these distinctions become most pronounced. A skilled artist can replicate the works I mentioned earlier but may falter when tasked with creating entirely new, original pieces. Regrettably, many graduates of art schools often find themselves functioning as little more than sophisticated copy machines.

I firmly believe that giftedness without practice is of limited value, and hard work alone, devoid of extraordinary capabilities, cannot lead to greatness. It is the synthesis of practice and inherent talent that paves the path to true mastery in art and many other fields.
