##### GPT correction

Certainly, let's go through your essay and identify any mistakes:

**Introduction:** "I disagree with this point of view, states are essential for maintaining justice, basic needs, and protection from other states and they can not achieve this without taxes."

Explanation: The introduction is clear and effectively communicates your disagreement with the given point of view. There are no significant mistakes in this part.

**"The government is the one source of money for sponsoring the basic needs of the citizens and infrastructural projects. Both are extremely costly and essential for normal function of country."**

Explanation: This part of the essay is clear and well-structured. However, there's a minor issue with the phrase "normal function of country." It might be better to say "normal functioning of a country" for correct grammar.

**"Big infrastructure projects like ports and airports provide small and large businesses ability to transport goods for lower prices."**

Explanation: The sentence effectively provides an example of how infrastructure projects benefit businesses. However, there is a minor grammatical issue. It should be "provide small and large businesses with the ability to transport goods for lower prices."

**"In addition, security of basic needs for all people decreases social instability."**

Explanation: This sentence is clear and effectively makes the point about the relationship between security of basic needs and social stability. There are no significant mistakes here.

**"Another key function of country that can not be accomplished without taxes is the justice system. The system is huge and consists of different elements such as police, courts, and jails, and to function properly and not be affected by corruption the system should be financed by the government."**

Explanation: This paragraph is well-structured and provides a strong argument about the importance of taxes for funding the justice system. There are no significant mistakes here.

**"Army is another costly component of country that is essential for protection from foreign powers. It has to be thought that in the modern world, it is an unnecessary thing, due to lack of conflicts, but the war between my country and Russia shows the opposite. Only a powerful military with great capability could protect citizens from extermination, and to create such military power the army must be provided with technologically advanced weapons in enormous quantities."**

Explanation: This section effectively discusses the military's role and the need for funding. However, there are a few minor improvements that can be made:

- Instead of "It has to be thought," you can say "It should be noted" or "It's important to consider."
- The phrase "the modern world, it is an unnecessary thing" can be rephrased for clarity. For example, "In the modern world, some may argue that it is unnecessary."
- Instead of "shows the opposite," you might say "contradicts this view."
- The sentence, "Only a powerful military with great capability could protect citizens from extermination," is clear, but it could be further enhanced by explaining why a powerful military is necessary.

**"Summing up, It is essential for each citizen to pay taxes for the proper function of the country and for the sake of one's safety and well-being."**

Explanation: The conclusion effectively summarizes your main points and restates your argument. However, there's a minor issue with capitalization. It should be "summing up, it is essential."

Overall, your essay is well-written with only minor grammatical issues. Your arguments are clear and well-structured.
