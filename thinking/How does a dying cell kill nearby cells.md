Title: How does a dying cell kill nearby cells?
tags: #thinking #cell_death

# Question
How does a cell that undergoes a cell death pathway kill nearby cells?

# Mechanisms to consider

## 1. DAMPs release upon membrane rupture
Necroptotic and pyroptotic cells lose membrane integrity, releasing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) into the extracellular space. These DAMPs activate innate immune receptors (TLRs, RAGE) on neighboring cells, triggering inflammation and potentially initiating death signaling.
-  [[mtDNA]], reduced HMGB1 due to the absence of caspase cleavage
- [[HMGB1]] — classical DAMP released passively during multiple death types
- [[CypA]] — early DAMP released during necrosis/necroptosis, not during apoptosis


## 4. Physical delivery systems — spreading death proteins
Cells can transfer organelles and proteins to neighbors through active delivery mechanisms, potentially including death-executing proteins.
- [[zombosomes]] — anucleated astrocyte fragments that actively migrate and transfer proteins (including pathological ones like p-a-syn); could they transfer death proteins?
- [[tunneling nanotubes]] — direct cell-to-cell connections that transfer organelles


## 5. ROS propagation
Dying cells generate reactive oxygen species that can diffuse to neighboring cells, promoting RIPK1 autophosphorylation and necrosome formation as part of a positive feedback loop.
- [[ROS and necroptosis]] — ROS promotes RIPK1 autophosphorylation at C161, facilitating necrosome formation; positive feedback loop
