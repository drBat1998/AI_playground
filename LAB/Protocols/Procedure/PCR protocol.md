# Reaction set-up
1. Gently vortex and briefly centrifuge all solutions after thawing.
2. Prepare a reaction master mix by adding the following components (except template DNA) for each 10 μl reaction to a tube at room temperature:

| Component                             | For 1 reaction | For ___ reactions |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Maxima Probe/ROX qPCR Master Mix (2X) | 5 μl           |                   |
| TaqMan® Gene Expression Assay (20X)   | 0.25 μl        |                   |
| Water, nuclease-free                  | 3.19 μl        |                   |
| Total volume                          | 8.5 μl         |                   |
Calculate the volume of each component of the PCR reaction mix by multiplying the volume of each component by the number of replicates for each sample.
We recommend performing four technical replicates of each reaction. Select the reaction size depending on the reaction plate used. Prepare 110% of the required volume to account for pipetting error.

3. Mix the master mix thoroughly and dispense appropriate volumes into an optical reaction plate
4. Add cDNA -1.5  μl to the optical reaction plate containing the master mix.
	Note. For two-step RT-qPCR, the volume of the cDNA added from the RT reaction should not exceed 10% of the final PCR volume.
5. Cover the plate with a MicroAmp® Optical Adhesive Film. For standard 96‐well plates, you may use MicroAmp® Optical Caps
6. Centrifuge the plate briefly to spin down the contents and eliminate air bubbles from the solutions.
7. Program the thermal cycler according to the recommendations 
8. Load the reaction plate into the real‐time PCR system
9. Start the run.
