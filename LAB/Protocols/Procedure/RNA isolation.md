# Stage 2 - Reverse transcription of DNase treated RNA

Materials required
	13 µl DEPC treated water
	16 µl 5X first strand buffer
	7 µl DTT (0.1 M)
	8 µl random primers (concentration = 0.1 µg/µl or a 1/30 dilution of the 3 µg/µl)
	8 µl BSA 
	3 µl dNTPs
	​1 µl RNase Out

Steps
1. For each sample, mix together the reagents by vortexing
	The total for each sample should be 56 µl
2. Aliquot 28 µl each into two separate 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes
	One tube will serve as the RT reaction (to which 2 µl of the MMLV reverse transcriptase is added) and the other, the no-RT control, to which 2 µl of H2O is added.
3. To each tube, add 10 µl of the DNase treated RNA from above
4. Mix well by pipetting
5. Incubate all samples at 37°C for 1 hr, then 95°C for 5 min
	The latter step fully inactivates remaining enzymes (i.e. MMLV RT and any remaining DNase).
6. Use immediately for PCR or store at -20°C first thing the next day
