Title: Phosphate Buffer



# Notes

0.2 М Фосфатний буфер (PB)
1. Na2PO4x2H2O  -  28.5 g / 800 ml H2O  (Na2HPO4 - 22,712 g)
2. NaH2PO4x2H2O  -  6.898 g / 250 ml H2O
3. Add second solution (2) to first (1) under the control of a pH meter until pH is 7.4
NB
- If you use something without H20, it could become cloistered and resolved poorly. The best practice is to use something to mix it and add water little by little.
