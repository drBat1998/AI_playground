## No amplification curve and no PCR product visible on a gel
**PCR inhibitors present in the reaction mixture.**
Re-purify your template DNA.
**Primer design is suboptimal.**
Verify your primer design, use reputable primer design programs or
validated pre-designed primers.
**RT-qPCR: inhibition by excess volume of the RT reaction.**
Volume of RT reaction product added to qPCR reaction should not exceed 10% of the total qPCR reaction volume.
**Pipetting error or missing reagent**. 
Repeat the PCR reaction; check the concentrations of template and primers; 
ensure proper storage conditions of all reagents. Make new serial dilutions of on a template DNA or RNA.
**Degradation of primers.**
Check PCR primers for possible degradation on polyacrylamide gel.
**Annealing temperature is not optimal.**
Optimize the annealing temperature in 3°C increments.
**UDG present in PCR protocol with low annealing temperature.**
When performing UDG pre-treatment with conventional UDG, the
temperature during PCR cycling should always be higher than 55°C. If
annealing temperatures must be lower than 55°C, use heat-labile UDG.


## No amplification curve but PCR product visible on a gel 
qPCR instrument settings are incorrect.
Check if instrument settings are correct (dye selection, reference dye,
filters).
Inactive fluorescence detection.
Fluorescent detection should be activated and set at annealing or
annealing/extension step of the thermal cycling protocol.
Instrument problems.
Refer to the instrument manual for troubleshooting.
Degradation of probe.
Check the probe for possible degradation on polyacrylamide gel

## Amplification signal in non-template control
DNA contamination of reagents.
-  Follow general guidelines to avoid carry over contamination or include UDG pre-treatment step at the beginning of PCR.
-  Discard reagents and repeat with new reagents.
RT-qPCR: RNA contaminated with genomic DNA.
Design primers on intron/exon boundaries, treat RNA sample with DNaseI,
RNA free (#EN0521) prior to reverse transcription. 

## PCR efficiency is >110%
Non-specific products.
Use gel electrophoresis to identify non specific amplicons.
Optimize your primer design to avoid such artifacts or use validated predesigned primers. 

## PCR efficiency is <90%
PCR inhibitors present in a reaction mixture.
Re-purify your template DNA.
PCR conditions are suboptimal.
Verify the primer/probe concentrations. Verify storage conditions of qPCR
master mix.
Primer design.
Verify your primer design, use primer design programs or validated predesigned primers. Avoid designing primers in regions with high DNA
secondary structure


## Poor standard curve
Excessive amount of template.
Do not exceed maximum recommended amounts of template DNA
(500 ng DNA for 25 μl reaction).
Suboptimal amount of template.
Increase the amount of template, if possible.
RT-qPCR: inhibition by excess volume of the RT reaction.
Volume of RT reaction product added to qPCR reaction should not exceed
10% of the total qPCR reaction volume.

## Non-uniform fluorescence intensity
Contamination of the thermal cycler.
Perform decontamination of your real-time cycler according to the
supplier’s instructions.
Poor calibration of the thermal cycler.
Perform calibration of the real-time cycler according to the supplier’s
instructions.
