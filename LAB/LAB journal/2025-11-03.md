[[Can I use HMGB1 as marker of necrosis?]]
HMGB1 is a molecule that is well known to be a marker of cell damage. Usually, it exists only inside the cell, and when the cell is damaged the HMGB1 starts leaking. Necrosis is accidental cell death that manifests as cell membrane rupture and so increasing permeability into and out the cell. So, it can be a marker of the accidental cell death, but does it only mark accidental cell death? The answer is probably no, cell membrane rupture occures in the context of majority of caspase-independent cell death pathways. Thus, HMGB1 may be a marker of a necrotic phenotype. I don't know how good it is compared to the LDH assay.
