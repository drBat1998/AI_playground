Firstly, I have done some English. I learned that nouns in the plural form which ends with f changed to a v letter, for example, a wife in a plural form is wives. Unfortunately, I have not progressed in my listening and reading skills.  In addition, even one word has not been added by me. 

However, I progressed in biomedical field. From today, I knew some information about APP. For instants, I reveal for myself that APP family proteins play important role in neurogenesis and neuroprotection. In addition, I more or less understood the process of APP cleavage and amyloid beta occurring. 

I hope that I am going to read the essay before going to bed.
