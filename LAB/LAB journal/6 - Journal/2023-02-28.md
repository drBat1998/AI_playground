From noun one I would write some journey notes. I have overthinking literally everything. Nowadays, I think about who am I in the philosophical sense, and how bad I am. So I struggled to define to what philosophical group I related the most, unfortunately, I am not a stoic, egoist, or pragmatic. 

My opinion about Dostoevsky just is shown. I think he thought about a human being in a good and idealistic way, but the 20th century clearly showed that a human is a monster more terrible than he thought. In Crime and Punishment, He has written that only one crime could change a human, but as life shows a person is more static than plastic.
