[[SH-N-SR]]
How constant the SN-N-SK cell line is. 
This cell line consists of two major morphologic subgroups: fibroblast-like and blast-like. So, the reproducibility is questionable. But, for now, I used neuronal cells obtained directly from the hippocampus of the rat. If we compare the primary hippocampal cell culture and SK-N-SH, we may see that although the cell line has different morphology and some genetic variability, the cell line consists of one cell type. In contrast, hippocampal neurons consist of neurons and glial cells in different proportions. So, results that come from the cell line may give better reproducibility. In addition, we can differentiate the cell line into neuron-like cells, which may further promote replication of our results.
