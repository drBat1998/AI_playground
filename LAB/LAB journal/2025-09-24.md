I need to make a phd paper more or less reliable. I am going to present what I have done this year to my colleagues. I want to read a paper, write about it, and create a plan for my code project. I hate myself for spending so much time on things that do not improve me, even for a bit. Additionally, I need to create a video set for Tumanovska. My writing skills have been decreasing, probably due to a lack of practice.
