Or maybe the CASP8 disactivation is not so essential?
It is a common assumption about necroptosis that it occurs only in cases of significant CASP8 inhibition, due to the ability of CASP8 to directly cleave RIPK3, an essential component of the necroptosis pathway. However, recent studies suggest that cell death may occur relatively independently of CASP8 activity. First, Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) may induce necroptosis by directly phosphorylating and though activate RIPK3. Second, partially crostalk with the first, is PANoptosis generation. In the context of PANoptosis, RIPK3 and CASP8 are not foes, but comrades that induce cell death in several pathways at the same time.
