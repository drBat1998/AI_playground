# Notes
## Introducation
Writing is a craft and not a natural gift. You can be better with your writing skills. William Zinsser was writing in old style, possibly with a typewriter, and for the typewriter's writer is essential to rewrite the piece that you are working on. In the modern age, the internet and computers give the ability to make mistakes and solve them in a matter of seconds. As a consequence, the good writer is becoming better, and the bad ones worse. 
## Part 1Principles
### 1. The Transaction
Writing is the craft; you have to commit time to practice it and gradually improve your skill in this field. It is not easy to write. It is not easy to think. It is not easy to formulate your thoughts clearly. And, for many, it is difficult to expose something to a critique, which writing most often is.
### 2. Simplicity
The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its clearest components.
### 3. Clutter
Every word must serve a purpose.

Reduce jargon, use words related to your field with the bare minimum. 

When editing your work, you may use the brackets around every unnecessary word or phrase.

Orwell pointed out in "Politics and the English Language," an essay written in 1946 but often cited during the Vietnam and Cambodia years of Presidents Johnson and Nixon, "political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. . . .
### 4. Style
First rules shall be mastered, then you may break them. 

## 5. The Audience
Who am I writing for?
We are writing to please you. Express what you want to say. But, do not forget to use clear and delightful sentences, for your pleasure's sake. 

## 6. Words
What is "journalese"?
It is the words are taken from other parts of speech.
adj to nouns (greats, notables)
nouns to the words (to host)

Be aware of what words you are using. Read and pay attention to what words are used by others now and used ages ago.

Create a dictionary of synonyms

Read the sentences aloud; although the reader reads in silence, in his head, he pronounces them.

## 7. Usage
Interesting thought, the word that rapidly enters the language could be fast erased from it. 
# Methods
## 8. Unity
To call oneself a writer, you have to write constantly; the author suggests 6 months as a minimum term.

Writing by the author, just like code, is ultimately a question of solving a problem.

Unity is sparing the reader's mind. 
- pronoun - first person, or third person.
- unity of tense - past or present
- mood - choose not to mix 

How much do I want to cover? 
What one point do I want to make?
## 9. The lead and the ending
You must capture the reader's attention with the first few sentences.
- "I've often wondered what goes into a hot dog. Now I know, and I wish I didn't."

The last sentences of each paragraph somehow have to be connected to the next paragraph.
Read more materials than are to be used. 
Everybody wants to be told a story.

## 10. Bits and Pieces
Verbs
- Active construction is preferable. 
- Verbs must be precise. stepped down -> resign, retire, fired.

Adverbs
- A precise verb rarely needs an adverb. (Radio blared loudly -> blare connotes loudness)

Adjectives
- Use adjectives only if the noun is not sufficient. If it is possible, choose a perfect noun. 

Little qualifiers
- ex: a bit, a little, sort of, kind of.
- use as little as posible

Punctuation
- The period - separate thoughts.
- the exclamation point.

Mood changers. 
	If your writing changes direction, you have to use:
		but, yet, however, still, instead, and several more
		This improves the readability of your piece.
	If you change the time, you might use:
		meanwhile, now, today, and later.

Contractions
	- You may use contractions, 
	- Read the text aloud, and you feel the difference. 
	- Do not use "'d" if it is posible, due to the meaning might be would and had. 

that and which
- In most cases, use "that"
- If you need a comma, you can use "which"

Concept nouns
- Better use verb and actions than concept nouns
The common reaction is incredulous laughter. -> Most people just laugh with disbelief. 

Creeping nounism
- too many nouns
- We have money problem areas. -> We went broke. 
- We have precipitation activity or a thunderstorm probability situation -> It is raining.

Overstatement

Credibility
- Talk truthfully if you are caught in a lie; all writing would be suspected. 
Dictation
- Find time for reading and editing your work. 

Writing is not a contest.

Paragraphs
- short, it makes readers feel that the text is light enough to read. 

Sexism

Rewriting 
- essence of writing as well.
- The first draft often is not what you want to say.
- Rewriting is an essential part and the most important part of writing.

Trust Your Material. 
# Part III
## 11. Nonfiction as literature
## 12. Writing about people (The Interview)
Get people talking/
Learn to ask questions. 
## 13. Writing about places
You want to tell a story, part of the travel, not "all moments and all even insignificant details" 

One of style, the other of substance.
## 14. Science and technology
A tenet of journalism is "the reader knows nothing".    

Describing how a process works is valuable for two reasons.
1. Make sure YOU know how it works. 
	1. Step by step gide for a person that now nothing about the concept.
	2. Upside-down pyramid.

Connect to ordinary life,
- your is the best, volnerability and change create a good story.
- other is fine

Always start with too much material and give your reader just enough. 
Primo Levi
Peter Medawar
Liver Scks
Charles Darwin
