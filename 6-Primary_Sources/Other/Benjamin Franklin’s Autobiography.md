Debating and Writing Practice
- Franklin describes a youthful debate with his friend Collins about women’s education.
- To strengthen his arguments, Franklin began writing letters back and forth with Collins.
- His father reviewed Franklin’s writing and pointed out weaknesses in style, order, and clarity, even though Franklin’s spelling and punctuation were superior.
- To improve, Franklin used The Spectator essays as a model: he summarized them in notes, later rewrote them from memory, then compared his version to the original.
- He also practiced by turning prose into verse and back again, and by shuffling his notes into random order and reorganizing them — exercises that taught him vocabulary, variety of expression, and methodical arrangement of thought.
