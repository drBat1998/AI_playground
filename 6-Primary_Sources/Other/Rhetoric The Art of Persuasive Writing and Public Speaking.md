## Module 1: Introduction to Rhetoric

History of rhetoric
Rhetorical structure and style

What is it that the author wants you to believe or do? 
How do you know? 
What evidence does the author use to support his or her opinion? 
What type of language does he or she use for emphasis or description?

The op-ed is an opinion piece by an independent writer. It traditionally appeared on the opposite page from the editorial—hence the name.

My Op-Ed Topic
Dostoevsky: the Russian devil and representation of the Russian soul.

[[ I Have a Dream Martin Luther King, Jr. ]]

The thesis is a substance, the idea that you want to communicate in a single declarative sentence.


 Three primary modes of appeal by Aristotle
 1. logos - “appeal to reason”
	 1. deductive reasoning -  It makes one or more propositions and then works through their logical implications.
		 In a democracy, decisions are made by majority consensus. 
		 While a consensus is being worked out, each person will be able to advocate for his or her own interests. 
		 Therefore, decisions in a democracy will reflect the interests of the majority of the people.
	 2. inductive reasoning - conclusions from examples or pieces of evidence.
		 - conclusive in proportion to how representative the example is
		 - If we admit an exception, then our argument is weakened
		Democracy is good for the overall success of a country; 
		many of the most powerful and prosperous nations in the world are ruled by democratic governments.
 2. ethos - “ethical appeal” is based on ==establishing the credibility== of the speaker or writer. Ethos is often deployed indirectly. A rhetor may establish ethos through actions as simple as using technical terms from a particular field to imply his or her knowledge of it.
	 In fifty years of studying the governments of nations on every continent, I have found that the more democratic the government, the happier the people.
 3. pathos -  the appeal to the audience’s emotions, involves artistic skills.
	 What is the alternative to democracy? Every man, woman, and child cowering in terror under the brutal rule of another Hitler, another Stalin! Not one home will be safe from the power of the State!
	 
Designing Arguments

The old Latin term “dispositio,” or “arrangement,” refers to the division of a piece of speech or writing into its components.

Classical rhetoric divided a composition into five parts: 
1) exordium, the introduction; 
2) narratio, the statement of the context or situation; 
3) confirmatio, the presentation of arguments and facts; 
4) refutatio, the presentation and refuting of counterarguments; and 
5) peroratio, the conclusion.

Style
- diction
	- The words you chose greatly impact both ethos and pathos
	- and shift the perception of your thought in both directions. If you use difficult words, it elevates your ethos but decreases your pathos and wise wersa. 
- syntax
	- simple or complex.
- schemes
	- omission - impact the speed
		- asyndeton - don't use conjunctions
			- Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, shrunk to this little measure?
		- polysyndeton - many conjunctions
			- And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
	- repetition  
		-  anaphora, or repetition, at the beginning of successive phrases
		- 
- tropes
	- ==Similes== will often use the words “as” or “like” to make a comparison.
	- If the comparison is implicit, we have a ==metaphor==


## Module 2: Civil Rights - Martin Luther King, Jr.

Schemes and Tropes
Tropes
1. Allusion - reference to a well-known piece of art.  
2. Metaphor - The use of a word or phrase to symbolically represent another word or concept in order to highlight the similarities between them. 

Schemes, or variations on sentence structure
1. Parallelism - A pairing (or grouping of several) related words, phrases, or sentences with the same or similar grammatical structure.
	1. "We can not dedicate — we can not consecrate — we can not hallow — this ground."
		—Abraham Lincoln
2. Anaphora - A form of parallelism, anaphora refers to the repetition of words at the beginning of successive clauses in a sentence. Such insistent repetition leds emphasis and builds momentum.
		"We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender..."
			—Winston Churchill

Patterns of Sound
1. Alliteration - Repetition of consonant sounds, especially at the beginning of phrases.
	1. "The vitality of language lies in its ability to limn the actual, imagined and possible lives of its speakers, readers, writers."
	—Toni Morrison, Nobel Lecture, 1993. External link The repetition of the "L" sound—"language," "lies," "limn," and "lives" lends the sentence its music.
2. Assonance - Repetition of vowel sounds
3. Sibilance - The word "sibilant" comes from a Latin root meaning "hissing." Sibilance refers to the repetition of sibilant consonant sounds, like "s," "sh," "z," and "j."


What is King's thesis?
Who is his audience?
What modes of appeal does he use?
What instances do you see of schemes and tropes, such as allusion, anaphora, and metaphor.
Do you note patterns of sound, such as alliteration, assonance, and sibilance?

What else do you notice?

## Day 1: Introduction, Isaac Backus
- Interpretation, judgment, beauty, and aesthetics
	- subjective and influenced by society and culture
- It may not be beautiful, but it may be well-written and provoke a set of emotions.
- How to judge and interpret the argument? 
- Rhetoric-free zone does not exist. 
- You can examine your own beliefs with your rhetoric. 
- Thinking about the best argument for your hypothesis and its counterargument gives you an enormous boost in credibility. 
- If you don't create a good counterargument to your argument, you give a field to attack you. And if you were caught with a counterargument that you had never thought about, you would be less truthful at minimum. 
- Seven lib Arts starts with Trivium:
	- grammar
	- logic
	- rhetoric
## Day 2: Culture and belief, Backus continued
rhetoric and belief
- Why do you believe in your beliefs? 
	- Experts
	- Culture and environment
	- Personal experience
	- Family
- How much of this belief is held on absolutely irrefutable ground?
- Emotion is also an important part of our beliefs.

## Day 3: Frederick Douglass
Read and write are keys to power. 
A Room of One's Own by Virginia Woolf. - the text about a quiet room away from shallow work.
[["What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" by  Frederick Douglass]]
In case your opponents distrust or dislike you prior to your speech, a good tactic is in exordium insert a few lines about this issue. 
Always keep your awareness, if you can, ahead of that
of your audience or your reader.
shift of pronouns, you can separate yourself from the audience, or join

## Day 4: Henry Clay
[[Henry Clay, Slavery and Abolition (1842)]]
tried - three words to increase the leangh and power.
Probable future fact
