# Notes
High-Content Imaging (HCI)
→ The core technology combining automated fluorescence microscopy with quantitative image acquisition.
→ Purpose: to capture and measure phenotypic changes in many individual cells across 2D/3D cultures.
→ HCI generates the raw image data for later analysis.

High-Content Screening (HCS)
→ The application of HCI in a screening format, where hundreds to millions of compounds are tested in parallel.
→ Goal: identify “hits” and assess cellular responses (on- and off-target effects) across multiple parameters.
→ HCS = HCI used for large-scale screening.

High-Content Analysis (HCA)
→ The computational step that applies multiparameter algorithms to the HCS/HCI data.
→ Purpose: extract, integrate, and interpret complex cellular features to generate predictive biological insights.
→ HCA = data analysis layer that makes sense of HCS results.
