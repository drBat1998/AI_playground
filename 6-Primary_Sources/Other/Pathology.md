### Reactions of Neurons to Injury
Neurons
- require a lot of resources
- have a long lifespan and high metabolic activity -> susceptible to accumulation of misfolded proteins

Acute neuronal injury (“red neurons”)
- CNS ischemia, hypoglycemia
- morphological markers of neuronal cell death
- 6-12 hours after hypoxic insult
- shrinkage of the cell body, 
- pyknosis of the nucleus, 
- disappearance of the nucleolus, 
- loss of Nissl substance, and 
- intense cytoplasmic eosinophilia.

Subacute and chronic neuronal injury (“degeneration”)
- loss of synapses, which may stem from aberrations in synaptic pruning
- reactive gliosis

Axonal reaction
- is a change observed in the cell body during regeneration of the axon; 
- it is best seen in anterior horn cells of the spinal cord when motor axons are cut or seriously damaged.
- The increase in protein synthesis that occurs in response to the injury is reflected in 
	- enlargement and rounding up of the cell body, 
	- peripheral displacement of the nucleus, 
	- enlargement of the nucleolus, and 
	- dispersion of Nissl substance from the center to the periphery of the cell (central chromatolysis).
Wallerian degeneration refers to degeneration of axons after disruption of nerve fibers

### Reactions of Astrocytes to Injury
Gliosis is the most important histopathologic marker of CNS injury, regardless of etiology, and is characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of astrocytes.
In gliosis, the nuclei of astrocytes (which are typically oval with evenly dispersed, pale chromatin) enlarge, become vesicular, and occasionally develop prominent nucleoli.
The previously indistinct cytoplasm becomes bright pink due to increased expression of GFAP , and the cells develop numerous stout, ramifying processes; these cells are called reactive or gemistocytic astrocytes.

Other types of astrocyte injury lead to the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies.
. Rosenthal fibers are thick, elongated, brightly eosinophilic, irregular structures that occur within astrocytic processes and contain two heat-shock proteins (αBcrystallin and hsp27) as well as ubiquitin. Rosenthal fibers are typically found in regions of long-standing gliosis; they are also characteristic of one type of glial tumor, pilocytic astrocytoma (see Fig. 28.49C). In Alexander disease, a leukodystrophy associated with mutations in the gene encoding GFAP , abundant Rosenthal fibers are found in periventricular, perivascular, and subpial locations. 
More commonly seen are corpora amylacea, or polyglucosan bodies. These are round, faintly basophilic, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)– positive, concentrically lamellated structures of 5 to 50 μm in diameter that are located wherever there are astrocytic end processes, especially in the subpial and perivascular zones. They consist primarily of glycosaminoglycan polymers, as well as heatshock proteins and ubiquitin. Corpora amylacea occur in increasing numbers with advancing age and are thought to represent a degenerative change in the astrocyte. Lafora bodies, which are seen in the cytoplasm of neurons (as well as hepatocytes, myocytes, and other cells) in a variant of myoclonic epilepsy, have a similar structure and biochemical composition

### Reactions of Microglia to Injury
Microglia respond to injury by (1) proliferating; (2) developing elongated nuclei; (3) forming aggregates around small foci of tissue necrosis (microglial nodules); or (4) congregating around cell bodies of dying neurons (neuronophagia)

### Reactions of Other Glial Cells to Injury
Oligodendrocytes are cells that wrap their cytoplasmic processes around axons and form myelin. Each oligodendrocyte myelinates numerous internodes on multiple axons, in contrast to the myelinating Schwann cell in peripheral nerves, which only myelinates the internode of a single axon. Injury or apoptosis of oligodendrocytes is a feature of acquired demyelinating disorders and leukodystrophies. 
Oligodendroglial nuclei may harbor viral inclusions in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Glial cytoplasmic inclusions, primarily composed of α-synuclein, are found in oligodendrocytes in multiple system atrophy (MSA).
Ependymal cells, the ciliated columnar epithelial cells lining the ventricles, do not show specific reaction patterns. When there is inflammation or marked dilation of the ventricular system, disruption of the ependymal lining is paired with proliferation of subependymal astrocytes to produce small irregularities on the ventricular surfaces (ependymal granulations). Certain infectious agents, particularly CMV, may produce extensive ependymal injury, with viral inclusions in ependymal cells. However, neither oligodendrocytes nor ependymal cells mediate significant responses to most forms of injury in the CNS.

## 6. Cerebrovascular Disease
[[Cerebrovascular disease]]—injury to the brain as a consequence of altered blood flow—can be grouped into ischemic and hemorrhagic etiologies, with tissue infarction the ultimate consequence of both

Stroke stems from two major  mechanisms:
- Ischemia and/or hypoxia resulting from impairment of blood supply and oxygenation of CNS tissue. This can be either a global or focal process, with the clinical manifestations determined by the region of brain affected. In the brain, embolism is a more common cause of vascular occlusion than thrombosis.
- Hemorrhage resulting from rupture of CNS vessels. Common etiologies include hypertension and vascular anomalies (aneurysms and malformations;

Hypoxia and Ischemia
it may be deprived of oxygen by either hypoxemia (low blood oxygen content) or ischemia (inadequate blood flow).
In addition to processes shared with ischemia in other parts of the body, ischemia in the CNS can result in inappropriate release of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters such as glutamate, which can damage neurons by allowing excessive influx of calcium ions through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors; this phenomenon is termed [[excitotoxicity]]. In the region of transition between necrotic tissue and the normal brain, there is an area of “at-risk” brain, referred to as the [[penumbra]]; this region can be rescued from cell death in many animal models with a variety of anti-apoptotic interventions, implying that ischemic neurons may die by apoptosis as well as necrosis.

Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Focal cerebral ischemia follows reduction or cessation of blood flow to a localized area of the brain due to partial or complete arterial obstruction.
The major source of collateral flow is the circle of Willis (supplemented by external carotid-ophthalmic artery collaterals). Inconstant collateral leptomeningeal vessels from the surface of the brain may also supply the distal branches of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries through cortical-leptomeningeal anastomoses; in contrast, there is little if any collateral flow for the deep penetrating vessels of the thalamus, basal ganglia, and deep white matter.

Occlusive vascular disease of severity sufficient to lead to cerebral infarction may be due to embolization from a distant source, in situ thrombosis, or various vasculitides

Both the gross and microscopic appearance of a nonhemorrhagic infarct changes over time. Grossly, there is little change in appearance during the first 6 hours of irreversible injury. By 48 hours, however, the tissue becomes pale, soft, and swollen, and the gray-white matter junction becomes indistinct. From 2 to 10 days, the brain becomes gelatinous and friable, and the previously ill-defined boundary between normal and infarcted tissue becomes more distinct as edema resolves in the viable adjacent tissue. 
From 10 days to 3 weeks, the tissue liquefies, eventually leaving a fluid-filled cavity that continues to expand until all of the dead tissue has been removed

Microscopically, the tissue reaction evolves along the following sequence: 
![[Screenshot 2024-10-27 at 16.07.56.png]]
• Acute infarct (Fig. 28.15A).
After the first 6 to 12 hours, neurons in the affected area show eosinophilic neuronal necrosis (increased eosinophilia of the cytoplasm followed by nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis; “dead [[red neurons]]”); both cytotoxic and vasogenic [[edema]] are present. There is loss of the usual tinctorial characteristics of white- and gray-matter structures. 
Endothelial and glial cells, mainly astrocytes, swell, and myelinated fibers begin to disintegrate. Up to 48 hours, neutrophilic emigration progressively increases and then falls off (but is never as prominent as in myocardial infarction).
• Subacute (evolving) infarct (Fig. 28.15B). Phagocytic cells, derived from circulating monocytes and activated microglia, are evident at 48 to 72 hours and become the predominant cell type in the ensuing 2 to 3 weeks. The macrophages become stuffed with the products of myelin breakdown or blood and may persist in the lesion for months to years. Reactive astrocytes and newly formed vessels can be seen at the periphery of the lesion as early as 1 week after the insult. As the process of liquefaction and phagocytosis proceeds, astrocytes at the edges of the lesion progressively enlarge, divide, and develop a prominent network of cytoplasmic extensions.
• Healed infarct (Fig. 28.15C). After several months, the astrocytic response recedes, leaving behind a dense meshwork of glial fibers admixed with new capillaries and some perivascular connective tissue. In the cerebral cortex, the cavity is separated from the meninges and subarachnoid space by a gliotic layer of tissue, which is derived from the molecular layer of the cortex. The pia and arachnoid are not affected. Infarcts undergo these reactive and reparative stages from the edges inward; thus, different areas of a lesion may appear chronologically divergent, revealing the natural progression of the response.

The features and temporal evolution of hemorrhagic infarctions parallel ischemic infarctions, with the addition of blood extravasation and resorption. In individuals receiving anticoagulant treatment, hemorrhagic infarcts may be associated with extensive intracerebral hematomas. Venous infarcts are often hemorrhagic and may occur after thrombotic occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus or other sinuses, or after occlusion of the deep cerebral veins. 
Neoplasms, localized infections, and other conditions leading to a hypercoagulable state increase the risk for venous thrombosis.

Lacunar Infarcts 
Hypertension affects the deep penetrating arteries and arterioles that supply the basal ganglia and hemispheric white matter as well as the brainstem; these cerebral vessels develop arteriolosclerosis, also known as small vessel disease because it affects arteries 40 to 900 μm in diameter, described in more detail later. If this disease process progresses to thrombosis and complete vessel occlusion, the end-result is development of small cavitary infarcts known as lacunes or lacunar infarcts (Fig. 28.16). These lakelike spaces, arbitrarily defined as less than 15 mm wide, can be single or multiple and involve the putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, internal capsule, deep white matter, caudate nucleus, and pons, in descending order of frequency. On microscopic examination, there is tissue loss surrounded by gliosis. Depending on their location in the CNS, lacunar infarcts can be clinically silent or cause severe neurologic impairment.  Affected vessels may also be associated with widening of the perivascular spaces without tissue infarction (état criblé).

Global Cerebral Hypoxia/Ischemia 
Global cerebral hypoxia or ischemia occurs when there is a generalized reduction of cerebral perfusion (as in cardiac arrest, shock, and severe hypotension) or decreased oxygen carrying capacity of the blood (e.g., in carbon monoxide poisoning). The clinical outcome varies with the severity and length of the insult. In mild cases, there may only be a transient postischemic confusional state, followed by complete recovery. Nevertheless, irreversible CNS damage may occur in individuals who experience global hypoxic and/or ischemic insults (diffuse hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy). Among 

[[Hierarchy of sensitivity to ischemia among CNS cells]]
CNS cells, there is a hierarchy of sensitivity to hypoxia/ ischemia: neurons are the most sensitive, although glial cells (oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) are also vulnerable. The most sensitive neurons in the brain are ==pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus== (especially area CA1, also referred to as Sommer sector), ==cerebellar Purkinje cells==, and ==pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex== (especially layers III and V); the molecular mechanisms underlying this selective vulnerability are not understood. With severe global cerebral hypoxia/ ischemia, widespread neuronal death occurs, irrespective of regional vulnerability; patients who survive this injury often remain in a persistent vegetative state. Other patients meet the current clinical criteria for “brain death,” including evidence of irreversible diffuse cortical injury (isoelectric, or “flat,” electroencephalogram), brainstem damage (such as absent reflexes and respiratory drive), and absent cerebral perfusion. When individuals with this pervasive form of injury are maintained on mechanical ventilation, the brain gradually undergoes widespread liquefaction, producing so-called “respirator brain.”Border zone (“watershed”) infarcts occur in the regions of the brain or spinal cord that lie at the most distal reaches of the arterial blood supply (i.e., the border zones between arterial territories). In the cerebral hemispheres, the border zone between the anterior and the middle cerebral artery distributions is at greatest risk. Damage to this region, located a few centimeters lateral to the interhemispheric fissure, results in a cortical wedge-shaped infarct that usually shows secondary hemorrhagic transformation (Fig. 28.17) and is often bilateral. Border zone infarcts usually develop after severe hypotensive episodes and are most commonly seen in patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest.

In the setting of global ischemia, the brain becomes edematous and swollen, producing widening of the gyri and narrowing of the sulci. The cut surface shows poor demarcation between gray and white matter. The microscopic features of irreversible ischemic injury evolve over time and mimic the changes seen in infarcts; the distinction between global and focal ischemic injury is based not on the nature of cellular pathology but on the overall pattern of brain involvement. Early changes, occurring 6 to 12 hours after the insult, are seen in neurons (dead red neurons described earlier); similar acute changes occur somewhat later in astrocytes and oligodendroglia. Subacute changes, occurring at 24 hours to 2 weeks, include tissue necrosis, influx of macrophages, vascular proliferation, and reactive gliosis. Repair, robust after approximately 2 weeks, is characterized by removal of necrotic tissue, loss of normal CNS architecture, and gliosis. In the cerebral neocortex, the neuronal loss and gliosis are uneven, with preservation of some layers and destruction of others, producing a pattern of injury termed laminar necrosis.
