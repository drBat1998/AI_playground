> Cell death represents a basic biological paradigm that governs outcomes and long-term sequelae in almost every hepatic disease. Necroptosis is a common form of programmed cell death in the liver. Necroptosis can be activated by ligands of death receptors, which then interact with receptor-interactive protein kinases 1 (RIPK1). RIPK1 mediates receptor interacting receptor-interactive protein kinases 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) and necrosome formation. Regarding the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial-mediated necroptosis, the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL necrosome complex can enhance oxidative respiration and generate reactive oxygen species, which can be a crucial factor in the susceptibility of cells to necroptosis. The necrosome complex is also linked to mitochondrial components such as phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM5), metabolic enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix, mitochondrial permeability protein, and cyclophilin D. In this review, we focus on the role of mitochondria-mediated cell necroptosis in acute liver injury, chronic liver diseases, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and its possible translation into clinical applications.

> Taken together, the results suggest that PGAM5 is downstream of RIPK1/RIPK3, induces necroptosis, and protects cells from necroptosis via promoting mitophagy [59] (Figure 1)

  **mPTP and Cyclophilin-D play regulated function during necrotposis.**
