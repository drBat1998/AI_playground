> Neuronal necroptosis and apoptosis are the most important pathways for programmed cell death after brain ischaemic stroke. Although apoptosis signalling pathways have been extensively studied, molecular mechanisms underlying necroptosis remain unclear. In this study, we found that receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) deficiency reduced cerebral infarction volume, neurological deficits, and neuronal ultrastructural damage in a mouse model of brain ischaemic stroke by inhibiting programmed cell death. RIP3 deficiency inhibited the activation of both calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) cascade, decreased the expression of classic necroptotic and apoptotic proteins, and ultimately decreased neuronal necroptosis and apoptosis. We further confirmed that RIP3 deficiency inhibited the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, the increase of calcium influx and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In addition, compared with WT primary cortical neurons, the decreased expression of CaMKII and Pyk2 was further verified in a Ripk3-/- primary cortical neurons underlying oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model. In conclusion, we first identified that the RIP3/CaMKII/Pyk2 pathway is involved in programmed cell death after brain ischaemic stroke, which suggests it is a promising therapeutic target in ischaemia-induced neuronal injury.

> CaMKII is a serinethreonine kinase involved in the regulation of calcium ions. It is a widely validated nodal signal that promotes cardiomyocyte death through several pathways (Joiner et al., 2012; Feng and Anderson, 2017), including necroptosis and apoptosis. The RIP3/CaMKII pathway has only been studied in myocardial ischaemia–reperfusion models. It is currently not known if this pathway mediates cell death in cerebral ischaemia models.

> In addition, a recent study showed that RIP3 directly activates CaMKII and induces myocardial necroptosis, instead of relying on RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL pathways as traditionally believed (Zhang et al., 2016).

> RIP3 can not only be activated by RIP1 (Moquin and Chan, 2010) but also be automatically activated after autophosphorylation at Ser229/Thr232 (Wu et al., 2014), reflecting the core position of RIP3 in necroptosis.

> Recent studies have found that RIP3 can further activate the phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM5) located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to mitochondrial damage and ultimately necroptosis (Wang et al., 2014a, 2014b; Xue et al., 2021).
