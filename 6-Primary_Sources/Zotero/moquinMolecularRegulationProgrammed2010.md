> Proper regulation of cell death is essential for metazoan development and functions. Unlike apoptosis, necrosis is a more inflammatory form of cell death that might contribute to antiviral immunity. Indeed, necrotic cell injury is distinguished from apoptosis by extensive organelle and cell swelling and plasma membrane rupture. Recent evidence indicates that an elaborate biochemical network emanating from receptors in the TNF superfamily can induce apoptosis as well as necrotic cell death. The induction of necrosis by TNF-like cytokines requires biochemical components that are distinct from those involved in apoptosis. Specifically, serine/threonine protein kinases in the receptor interacting protein (RIP) family are required for "programmed" necrotic cell injury. In this review, we discuss the molecular crosstalk between apoptosis and programmed necrosis, with a special emphasis on how caspases, protein ubiquitylation and phosphorylation regulate the induction of necrotic cell injury.

> ANT and CYPD are components of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) that regulates the exchange of ADP and ATP between the cytosol and the mitochondria (reviewed in [64]). During programmed necrosis, this ADP-ATP exchange function of the mPTP is  compromised [59]. Consistent with this observation, Cypd−/− cells are partially resistant to TNF-, IAP antagonist-, and zVAD-fmk induced programmed necrosis [28]. Thus, the cellular metabolic “fitness level” might greatly influence the outcome of pro-necrotic cell signaling, a notion that seems to be supported by the correlation between reduced cellular ATP level and increased susceptibility to necrotic cell injury in older individuals [57]. These recent findings suggest that different effector mechanisms operate in different cell types to mediate programmed necrosis
