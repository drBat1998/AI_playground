> The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invasive fungal infections. As a consequence, many successful fungal pathogens have evolved elegant strategies to interact with host immune cells. For example, Candida albicans undergoes a morphogenetic switch coupled to cell wall remodeling upon phagocytosis by macrophages and then induces macrophage pyroptosis, an inflammatory cell death program. To elucidate the genetic circuitry through which C. albicans orchestrates this host response, we performed the first large-scale analysis of C. albicans interactions with mammalian immune cells. We identified 98 C. albicans genes that enable macrophage pyroptosis without influencing fungal cell morphology in the macrophage, including specific determinants of cell wall biogenesis and the Hog1 signaling cascade. Using these mutated genes, we discovered that defects in the activation of pyroptosis affect immune cell recruitment during infection. Examining host circuitry required for pyroptosis in response to C. albicans infection, we discovered that inflammasome priming and activation can be decoupled. Finally, we observed that apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) oligomerization can occur prior to phagolysosomal rupture by C. albicans hyphae, demonstrating that phagolysosomal rupture is not the inflammasome activating signal. Taking the data together, this work defines genes that enable fungal cell wall remodeling and activation of macrophage pyroptosis independently of effects on morphogenesis and identifies macrophage signaling components that are required for pyroptosis in response to C. albicans infection.IMPORTANCECandida albicans is a natural member of the human mucosal microbiota that can also cause superficial infections and life-threatening systemic infections, both of which are characterized by inflammation. Host defense relies mainly on the ingestion and destruction of C. albicans by innate immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils. Although some C. albicans cells are killed by macrophages, most undergo a morphological change and escape by inducing macrophage pyroptosis. Here, we investigated the C. albicans genes and host factors that promote macrophage pyroptosis in response to intracellular fungi. This work provides a foundation for understanding how host immune cells interact with C. albicans and may lead to effective strategies to modulate inflammation induced by fungal infections.

> High-throughput screening of C. albicans-macrophage interactions. Macrophages are able to kill C. albicans, but C. albicans can also induce macrophage pyroptosis, resulting in the death of the host cell. To examine the impact of pyroptosis on the survival of C. albicans cells, we performed in vitro infections of macrophages with C. albicans in the presence or absence of potassium to inhibit pyroptosis (29) and measured the numbers of CFUs after 24 h of coincubation. Addition of 40 nM potassium did not inhibit fungal growth and was sufficient to block pyroptosis (see Fig. S1a in the supplemental material). We observed a decrease in fungal CFU levels when pyroptosis was inhibited (Fig. 1a), suggesting that fungi can use pyroptosis to evade killing by macrophages. To investigate the genetic circuitry governing the interactions between C. albicans and macrophages, we developed a high-throughput imaging-based screen to identify C. albicans genes required for induction of macrophage cell death. The C. albicans GRACE collection of 2,356 tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains (24, 30) was cocultured with J774A macrophages in the presence or absence of 0.05 g/ml doxycycline (DOX). This concentration of DOX has previously been demonstrated to repress gene expression in this system (24). After 3 h of coincubation, staining with propidium iodide (PI) was used to estimate the rate of macrophage cell death. For each batch of macrophages, each mutant was evaluated relative to a wild-type control, using the log of propidium iodide (PI) counts as a function of optical density at 600 nm (OD600) and the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing method (LOESS) (Fig. 1b; see also Fig. S1). A key aspect of the interaction between C. albicans and macrophages is the morphological transition from yeast to filamentous growth. Although most C. albicans mutants that are defective in filamentation are unable to induce macrophage pyroptosis, filamentation is neither necessary nor sufficient for activation of pyroptosis (23, 24). To identify the subset of C. albicans factors that are required specifically for activation of macrophage cell death (and not filamentation), we also determined the morphology of each C. albicans GRACE strain during macrophage infection using high-throughput imaging. This allowed categorization of mutants into those that affect pyroptosis only, both pyroptosis and morphogenesis, or morphogenesis only (Fig. 1c).

Macrophages are the first line of defense against multiple intruders, including fungi. Fungi, to protect themselves inside our organism, evolve mechanisms to trigger a specific inflammatory death program called pyroptosis. To screen a massive number of genes in Candida albicans that may promote death, the Gene Replacement And Conditional Expression collection was used. The library consists of strains in that each gene of interest can be turned on and off by adding doxycycline to the well. For high-throughput imaging, the authors used propidium iodide as a marker of the loss of plasma membrane integrity.
