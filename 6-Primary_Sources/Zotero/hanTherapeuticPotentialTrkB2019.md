> The clinical trials employing neuroprotectants targeting single, early pathogenic mechanisms in stroke have so far been barely successful. We found in human  postmortem stroke brains that in addition to apoptosis, necroptosis also  contributed to neuronal damage. Thus, a new strategy targeting both mechanisms  might be necessary. While brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a potent  survival factor for neurons, its poor bioavailability including low diffusion  rate and short half-life makes it unlikely a therapeutic agent. We recently  developed a TrkB agonistic antibody (Ab4B19) that mimicked BDNF functionally but  exhibited better physicochemical and pharmacological features. We showed that  Ab4B19 halted neuronal death in vitro under multiple conditions that simulate  ischemia/reperfusion injury, including oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD),  glutamate toxicity, oxidative stress and nutrient deprivation. In a rat model of  ischemia/reperfusion, Ab4B19 suppressed both apoptosis and necroptosis, leading  to a reduction in infarct volume and acceleration of functional recovery from  sensorimotor impairments. In neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells  (hESCs), Ab4B19 activated TrkB and its downstream signaling, and rescued neuronal  death from OGD at a similar level as that in mouse neurons. Together, our study  revealed necroptosis in human stroke brain, and demonstrated a BDNF-based  strategy targeting both apoptosis and necroptosis for ischemic stroke treatment.

  **Apoptosis level in postmortem humna speciement increased in core region, but not in the peri-infarct regions. On the contrarty MLKL increase bothe in central and in pereferia of the lesion.**
