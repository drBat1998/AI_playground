> BACKGROUND: The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration and subsequent retinal atrophy are hallmarks of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Amyloid-beta (Aβ), the primary component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is also present within drusen and is considered a critical factor contributing to RPE degeneration in AMD. Recent findings indicate that Aβ-induced inflammation plays a role in RPE degeneration. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular players and the precise mechanisms involved in this process, particularly the potential role of the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like receptors (ALRs) inflammasome.
METHODS: An animal model of Aβ1-40-induced RPE injury was established. Fundus photography, electrophysiology and hematoxylin-eosin staining were used to evaluate the morphological and functional RPE damage. Transcriptome sequencing was used to detect the differentially expressed genes between Aβ1-40 group and control group. The transcriptional and protein expression levels of AIM2 pathway and RIPK family members were detected. Adeno-associated virus vector 2/2 (AAV2/2)-shAIM2 was constructed to knockdown AIM2 expression in mice RPE cells. Aβ1-40-treated ARPE-19 cells and hRPE cells were employed to analyze the regulatory effects of RIPK family on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release and AIM2 pathway activation.
RESULTS: Aβ induces RPE damage through stimulation of AIM2 inflammasome and augmentation of caspase-1 and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Knocking down AIM2 inhibits the release of inflammatory cytokines and alleviates the degeneration of the retina and RPE. Simultaneously, Aβ triggers the activation of RIPK1/RIPK3 kinases, as manifested by heightened protein expression and phosphorylation. Inhibiting RIPK1/RIPK3 phosphorylation dampens AIM2 inflammasome activity and curtails IL-1β secretion. Mechanistically, RIPK1/RIPK3 inhibition attenuates Aβ-induced Drp1(S616) hyperphosphorylation, consequently reducing mitochondrial fission and the efflux of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol. The diminished mtDNA release is responsible for attenuated AIM2 activation and subsequent inactivation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING)/nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling cascade.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to validate AIM2's contribution in Aβ-induced RPE pathology and underscore the significance of the RIPK1/RIPK3-induced mtDNA release in modulating inflammatory responses, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutics of AMD.

> ation was transient, peaking on day 2 poststimulation and returning to baseline levels by day 4. To ascertain the role of the RIPK family, we employed the RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1 (Fig. 5C-D) and the RIPK3 inhibitor GSK872 (Fig. 5E). Both inhibitors effectively reduced RIPK phosphorylation and expression on day 2, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism in the regulation  of RIPK1/3 expression and activation. Besides, in vitro inhibition of RIPK activation significantly attenuated Aβ-induced activation of AIM2 pathway (Fig. 5G-H, Supplementary Fig. 7) and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 5I)

> Importantly, RIPK inhibition led to decreased expression of AIM2 pathway molecules in both mouse RPE cells (Fig. 6A-E), the ARPE-19 cell line (Fig. 6F-G) and the hRPE cells (Supplementary Fig. 7). Otherwise, knockdown of RIPK1 and RIPK3 markedly attenuated the Aβ1−40-induced upregulation and activation of AIM2 and IL-1β proteins (Supplementary Fig. 8), suggesting that RIPK1/3-mediated signaling is involved in the inflammasome activation triggered by Aβ stimulation. RIPK inhibitors also improved the overall structure (Fig. 7A-E) and function of the retina and RPE (Fig. 7F-I), although some abnormalities persisted, possibly due to off-target effects of Nec-1. In summary, Aβ1−40 activated the RIPK1/3 pathway, triggering downstream AIM2 inflammation and consequent RPE degeneration. A
