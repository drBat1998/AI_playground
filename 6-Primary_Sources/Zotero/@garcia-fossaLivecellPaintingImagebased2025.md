> AO monomers intercalate between neighboring pairs of DNA and RNA, absorbing blue light (∼458 nm) and emitting green light (∼530 nm). At higher concentrations in cells, AO interacts electrostatically with DNA and RNA and can also organize into stacks and accumulate in acidic vesicles. When AO is organized as stacks, it will shift the emission spectra to red light (∼640 nm).

> Prostate cells (PNT1A and PC-3) showed even lower tolerance to AO exposure; the maximum AO concentration that did not affect cell viability was 2.5 μM (Supplemental Figure S1). Higher AO concentrations did not significantly reduce cell viability in prostate cells; however, they caused pronounced morphological changes (e.g., diminished distinction between the nucleus and cytoplasm), which influenced our decision to use the 2.5 μM concentration

> We conclude that cell tolerance to AO is cell type dependent; therefore, it is imperative to evaluate cell viability to determine the AO concentration with minimal toxicity while maintaining its ability to stain cell compartments. 
  **So, the neuron AO concentration must be ditermine.**

> However, control staining with Rab7, a marker of late endosomes, revealed no overt changes in the distribution of Rab7-positive vesicles following treatment (Supplemental Figure S3). This suggests that the observed AO signal dynamics may not solely reflect changes in vesicle abundance or localization, but could also be influenced by altered dye uptake or accumulation. These results emphasize the need for caution when interpreting AO-based phenotypes, as they may reflect perturbations in dye accumulation rather than only structural changes in acidic compartments.

> Collectively, these findings suggest that AO successfully captured the cellular state of acidic vesicles, and this approach can provide fine details about the cell response to perturbation.

> To determine whether AO intensity is affected by nanoparticle concentration, we measured AO-Green and AO-Red intensity per cell under each treatment condition. Our results indicate that total AO intensity per well (Green and Red) increased with higher AgNP concentrations, even as the number of acidic vesicles decreased (Supplemental Figure S5).

> Concentrations detectable by LCP were up to 40 times lower than the IC10 value, based on values previously determined with MTT (i.e., the inhibitory concentration of 10% of the population), indicating a greater sensitivity.

> AO staining  Huh-7 cells were plated at a density of 8000 cells per well in 96-well plates and grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. After 24 h, the cells were treated in triplicate with 100 μl of a range of AO concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 μM) diluted in a nonsupplemented medium (serum-free). Then, cells were incubated for 10 min at 37°C and 5% CO2. After 10 min, the AO solutions were replaced by 100 μl of FluoroBrite DMEM (Life Technologies). Fluorescence images were acquired on Cytation 5 Hybrid Multidetection Reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT), from herein called Cytation 5, using the filter cubes from BioTek named green fluorescence protein (GFP; excitation/emission = 469/525 nm) and propidium iodide (PI; excitation/emission = 531/647 nm). A 20× with NA 0.45 objective was used, with a pixel size of 0.321895 μm/pixel (equivalent to 3.106599 pixels/μm). Each well was imaged across 16 fields of view, with an image resolution of 1224 × 904 pixels and a bit depth of 16 bits.

> Image processing and analysis  A cellpose model was trained on images from Huh-7 cells stained with AO to identify the nuclei object using the cellpose GUI (Pachitariu and Stringer, 2022) (model available here https://github.com/broadinstitute/scripts_notebooks_fossa/tree/ main/cellpose/Acridine_Orange_Model_Huh7). One image from every experiment was randomly selected to create the train and test. The models were used to segment the nuclei on all our analysis pipelines using the CellProfiler plugin RunCellpose that runs cellpose custom models (Weisbart et al., 2023). To segment cell boundaries, we used the AO-GFP channel, which highlights RNA staining in the cytoplasm, facilitating accurate segmentation using the propagation method implemented on CellProfiler. This method defines where the boundaries between objects are by a combination of proximity to the nearest primary object and variations in intensity gradients (see Supplemental Figures S17 and S19 for overlay examples). Then, a pipeline was created on CellProfiler version 4.2.5 to segment the nuclei, cells, cytoplasm, nucleoli, and vesicles, and an overlay of the segmented objects was created above the images to check for image segmentation (Carpenter et al., 2006; Stirling et al., 2021). The pipeline was run for one image of every well in every plate before running the analysis, to check for errors in object segmentation. An example pipeline is available here https://github.com/broadinstitute/scripts_notebooks_fossa/ tree/main/cellprofiler/LiveCellPainting_pipeline. After segmentation, features were extracted from the singlecell objects using CellProfiler modules. Features related to the area and shape of the objects were extracted, such as area, perimeter, and HuMoment (Hu, ); the integrated, mean, and other features related to pixel intensity were measured in every channel and object (cell, nuclei, and cytoplasm); the degree and nature of textures in images and objects to quantify their roughness and smoothness (Haralick et al., 1973). The cells were segmented into four concentric rings going from the center of the cell to the border of the cell, and the total and mean intensity of the AO-Green and AO-Red was measured within each ring. The pipelines were run using a version of CellProfiler optimized to run inside Amazon Web Services, the Distributed-CellProfiler (Weisbart and Cimini, 2023). To join the CSV files generated per site, the pycytominer function collate from the “cyto utilities” package was used (Serrano et al., 2025).

> gregated from single-cell to well-aggregated profiles using the median function from the Pycytominer function “aggregate.” Annotation was also performed with Pycytominer to add all relevant information for each data frame, such as compound name, the concentration used, cell type, etc. The features were normalized relative to the negative control on a per-plate basis to address batch effects using the RobustMAD function, which takes the feature value (x) minus the median divided by the median absolute value (scaled feature = [x − median/mad]). Feature selection was performed to exclude features that have more than 5% of NA values, features with low variance, features that correlate higher than 90%, and features that have values higher than 500 (outliers). Notebooks for profiling are available here https://github.com/broadinstitute/ scripts_notebooks_fossa/tree/main/profiles/cellprofiler. Batch correction was applied to correct the effect of performing the experiment on different days. pyCombat (an implementation of ComBat in Python; example notebook is available here https://github.com/broadinstitute/scripts_notebooks_fossa/ blob/main/pycombat_umap/apply_pycombat_visualize.ipynb) (Behdenna et al., 2020) was used because of its characteristic of correcting for batch effect in small sample sizes. From here, when a profile is defined, we consider that all these steps were applied before analyzing the results.

> Profile evaluation  The replicate retrieval ability was measured using mAP. It measures the ability of a replicate to retrieve other replicates without classifying the negative control as a replicate. A query is created to retrieve replicates or negative controls, and a rank order is created. From those, the area under the precision-recall curve is measured. More details are available in (Dijk et al., 2024). The test was performed using the evalzoo/matric library available at https://github.com/cytomining/evalzoo/tree/main/matric. To visualize the profiles in a dimensionality-reduced space, t-SNE (Maaten and Hinton, 2008) or UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) (McInnes et al., 2020) was used to generate the vectors for visualization. The embeddings were generated for 100 iterations, and the mean and SD embeddings were calculated and presented in the plots. HDBSCAN was performed by following the example available at https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clustering.html. UMAP is used for dimensionality reduction, and HDBSCAN is performed to predict the labels based only on the density of the points (an unsupervised clustering method).
