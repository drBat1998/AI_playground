> Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are immunomodulatory compounds produced by the microbiome through dietary fiber fermentation. Although generally considered beneficial for gut health, patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) display poor tolerance to fiber-rich diets, suggesting that SCFAs may have contrary effects under inflammatory conditions. To investigate this, we examined the effect of SCFAs on human macrophages in the presence of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. In contrast to anti-inflammatory effects under steady-state conditions, we found that butyrate and propionate activated the NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in the presence of TLR agonists. Mechanistically, these SCFAs prevented transcription of FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) through histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, triggering caspase-8-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation. SCFA-driven NLRP3 activation was potassium efflux independent and did not result in cell death but rather triggered hyperactivation and IL-1β release. Our findings demonstrate that butyrate and propionate are bacterially derived danger signals that regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation through epigenetic modulation of the inflammatory response.

> Markedly, butyrate and propionate triggered IL-1b release following co-incubation with LPS and butyrate at a concentration of LPS that did not elicit IL-1b release alone (Figure S1C). This demonstrates that SCFAs generally activate IL-1b release from myeloid cells in the presence of LPS

> The requirement for loss of cFLIP expression suggested that caspase-8 would be required for SCFA-mediated NLRP3 activation. Therefore, we assessed caspase-8 activity in hMDMs following stimulation with LPS, butyrate, or the combination and found that butyrate increased caspase-8 activity in both the absence or presence of LPS (Figure 5A) and that butyrate and propionate, but not nigericin, triggered caspase-8 cleavage (Figure 5B). To determine whether caspase-8 was required for NLRP3 activation, we pre-incubated hMDMs with z-IETD-FMK, a capase-8 inhibitor, prior to stimulation with LPS and butyrate and determined that it inhibited butyrate-mediated NLRP3 activation, as shown by IL-1b release (Figure 5C), IL-1b cleavage (Figure 5D), and caspase-1 cleavage (Figure S5A). IETD substrate cleavage occurred prior to NLRP3 activation, as it was not inhibited by either CP-456,773 or VX-765 (Figure S5B). We confirmed this result by knocking down caspase-8 (Figure S5C), which ablated butyrate-mediated IL-1b release (Figure 5E), IL-1b cleavage (Figure 5F), and caspase-1 cleavage (Figure 5F). In contrast, it had no effect on NLRP3 activation by nigericin (Figure 5F), nor did it alter NLRP3 or pro-IL-1b protein levels (Figure S5C).

> The absence of potassium efflux, ASC speck formation, and cell death accompanying butyrate-mediated NLRP3 activation was surprising. This is reminiscent of the alternative pathway of NLRP3 activation triggered by LPS in monocytes24 or NLRP3 hyperactivation in response to oxidized PAPC (oxPAPC),44 where the cells also release IL-1b without the accompanying cell death. Indeed, despite butyrate-mediated activation of caspase-1, -3, and -7, IL-1b release was independent of gsdmD and gsdmE, consistent with the cells not becoming permeable to the exclusion dye, suggesting that pore-forming proteins are not involved in IL-1b release. It is unclear how IL1b is released in response to butyrate, though one possibility is the non-classical secretion pathway, which is reliant on the autophagy system and has been shown to release IL-1b in other contexts.45 Alternatively, it has been shown recently that cleaved IL-1b could be translocated to the Golgi and secreted through the canonical secretion pathway.46 Further research will be required to delineate the exact mechanism, as well as how the hMDMs survive in spite of having multiple active caspases.
