> Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a multifaced protein that plays important roles in multiple inflammatory conditions. However, the role of MIF in endothelial cell (EC) death under inflammatory condition remains largely unknown. Here we show that MIF actively promotes receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)-mediated cell death under oxygen-glucose deprivation condition. MIF expression is induced by surgical trauma in peripheral myeloid cells both in perioperative humans and mice. We demonstrate that MIF-loaded myeloid cells induced by peripheral surgery adhere to the brain ECs after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) and exacerbate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Genetic depletion of myeloid-derived MIF in perioperative ischemic stroke (PIS) mice with MCAO following a surgical insult leads to significant reduction in ECs apoptosis and necroptosis and the associated BBB disruption. The adoptive transfer of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from surgical MIFΔLyz2 mice to wild-type (WT) MCAO mice also shows reduced ECs apoptosis and necroptosis compared to the transfer of PBMC from surgical MIFf  l/f  l mice to MCAO recipients. The genetic inhibition of RIPK1 also attenuates BBB disruption and ECs death compared to that of WT mice in PIS. The administration of MIF inhibitor (ISO-1) and RIPK1 inhibitor (Nec-1s) can both reduce the brain EC death and neurological deficits following PIS. We conclude that myeloid-derived MIF promotes ECs apoptosis and necroptosis through RIPK1 kinase-dependent pathway. The above findings may provide insights into the mechanism as how peripheral inflammation promotes the pathology in central nervous system.
