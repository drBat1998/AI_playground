> We showed previously that TRIF deficiency very mildly ameliorates but does  not prevent skin inflammation in RIPK1E-KO mice14, suggesting that TRIF is not essential for RIPK3 activation and necroptosis in RIPK1deficient epidermal keratinocytes.

> We hypothesised that other RHIM-containing proteins may induce RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis in RIPK1-deficient keratinocytes. In addition to RIPK1 and RIPK3, the only other proteins containing  RHIM in humans and mice are TRIF and ZBP13,6,19,20.

> The mechanism by which RIPK1 counteracts RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis has remained enigmatic. Here we show that RIPK1 prevents skin inflammation by inhibiting Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1, also named DAI or DLM1)-mediated activation of RIPK3/MLKLdependent necroptosis. ZBP1 deficiency inhibited keratinocyte necroptosis and skin inflammation in mice with epidermis-specific RIPK1 knockout. Moreover, mutation of the conserved RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) of endogenous mouse RIPK1 (RIPK1mRHIM) caused perinatal lethality that was prevented by RIPK3, MLKL or ZBP1 deficiency.

> ZBP1 deficiency  also reduced the number of TUNEL+ keratinocytes in the epidermis of  RIPK1E-KO mice (Extended data Fig. 1e, f), suggesting that it prevented  keratinocyte necroptosis.

> We therefore hypothesised that ZBP1 might be implicated in triggering RIPK3 activation and necroptosis in epidermal  keratinocytes of RIPK1E-KO mice. Immunoblot analysis of epidermal extracts showed that ZBP1 was expressed at low levels in wild type  mice but its expression was strongly increased in the epidermis of  RIPK1E-KO mice at the age of four weeks (Fig. 1a), supporting that ZBP1 could be involved in triggering keratinocyte necroptosis in this model.

> Therefore, in contrast to RIPK1 deficiency that causes perinatal lethality due to both caspase-8-mediated apoptosis  and RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis15-17, mutation of RIPK1 RHIM caused perinatal death exclusively due to ZBP1/RIPK3/MLKLdependent necroptosis

> herefore, disruption of the RHIM-dependent interaction of RIPK1 with RIPK3 protected primary FLMs and MEFs from TNF-induced necroptosis.  TNF-induced NF-κB activation was not impaired in Ripk1mRHIM/mRHIM MEFs or FLMs (Fig. 3e, f), showing that RHIM-dependent RIPK1 interactions are not required for TNFR1-induced proinflammatory signalling.

> Moreover, reciprocal immunoprecipitation using anti-RIPK1 antibodies and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG or anti-ZBP1 antibodies also failed to detect an interaction between RIPK1 and ZBP1 (Fig. 4g). Therefore, in contrast to RIPK3, RIPK1 did not interact with ZBP1 in primary MEFs. It is not clear why our results differ from previous studies showing that ZBP1 interacted with RIPK1  in 293T cells19,20, but this could be related to the absence of RIPK3  expression in 293T cells9.

> Thus, ZBP1 induces keratinocyte necroptosis in the absence of RIPK1 but it is not required for keratinocyte necroptosis and skin inflammation caused by epidermal FADD deficiency. 
  **How does FADD deficiency lead to necroptosis?**
