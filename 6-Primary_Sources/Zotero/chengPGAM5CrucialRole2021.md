> In response to mitochondrial damage, mitochondria activate mitochondrial dynamics to maintain normal functions, and an imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics triggers multiple programmed cell death processes. Recent studies have shown that phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) is associated with mitochondrial damage. PGAM5 activates mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy to promote a cellular compensatory response when mitochondria are mildly damaged, whereas severe damage to mitochondria leads to PGAM5 inducing excessive mitochondria fission, disruption to mitochondrial movement, and amplification of apoptosis, necroptosis and mitophagic death signals, which eventually evoke cell death. PGAM5 functions mainly through protein-protein interactions and specific Ser/Thr/His protein phosphatase activity. PGAM5 is also regulated by mitochondrial proteases. Detection of PGAM5 and its interacting protein partners should enable a more accurate evaluation of mitochondrial damage and a more precise method for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

[[H2O2-induced necroptosis]]

> In H2O2-induced necroptosis, AMPK is activated, which promotes Keap1-mediated degradation of PGAM5 and attenuates necroptosis (Y.S. Wang et al., 2018). A RIP3 knockout only prevents TNF-α induced necroptosis, whereas a PGAM5 knockout also prevents ROS-induced necroptosis (Wang et al., 2012), indicating that PGAM5 plays an important role in oxidative stress-induced necroptosis again.

> She et al. (2019) have demonstrated that knockout or inhibition of PGAM5 reduced necroptosis by inhibiting Drp1, and ameliorated myocardial I/R injury in rats. Inhibition of the Ripk3–PGAM5–CypD–mPTP pathway attenuates cardiac microvascular I/R injury (Zhou et al., 2018). Additionally, metformin, an AMPK agonist, promotes Keap1 degradation of PGAM5 and attenuates myocardial I/R injury (Y.S. Wang et al., 2018). Thus, exploring the role of PGAM5 in myocardial I/R injury may provide a strategy for its diagnosis and treatment.
