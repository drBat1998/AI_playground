> In 2019, Kanneganti et al . named this complex mode of cell death PANoptosis, which is activated by specific triggers and regulated by the PANoptosome; it has the key characteristics of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, but its effects cannot be explained by the occurrence of any of these individual types of programmed cell death alone [7, 8].

> Researchers have reported that the loss of a single component that drives pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis is often insufficient to prevent lytic cell death, indicating redundancies among upstream regulators.

> PANoptosis is a unique innate immune inflammatory PCD pathway that is mechanistically regulated by multifaceted PANoptosome complexes with morphological characteristics

> Multiple PANoptosome sensors and regulators are required for eliciting PCD. For example, the PANoptosome was shown to contain RIPK1, RIPK3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), NLRP3, ZBP1, CASP1, CASP6, and CASP8, which are components of the PANoptosome in response to IAV infection [22, 23]

> The sensor proteins that participate in the formation of the PANoptosome include ZBP1, absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), RIPK1, and RIPK12.

> The adapter proteins include ASC and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD).

> The effector proteins include the proteolytic enzymes CASP8, CASP1, CASP3, and CASP6; the RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) domain-containing proteins RIPK1 and RIPK3; the pore-forming proteins gasdermin D (GSDMD) and gasdermin E; and mixed-lineage kinase domain-like proteins (MLKL)
