> Ischemic stroke often results in severe injury to white matter structures including the axons, oligodendroglia, and other glial cells. Immature stages of  oligodendroglia, such as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and premature  oligodendroglia, are more vulnerable to ischemia than mature oligodendroglia.  Extensive studies have been performed on the necroptosis of neurons following  cerebral ischemia. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of  necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), a necroptosis inhibitor, on the survival of OPCs and  long-term functional recovery following transient cerebral ischemia. Male adult  ICR mice (25-30 g) were subjected to 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion  (MCAO) and 24 h of reperfusion. Nec-1 (0.04 mg/kg) was injected  intracerebroventricularly 1 h before the onset of MCAO. Cognitive functions were  evaluated ≤30 days after MCAO. Necroptosis-related proteins, receptor-interacting  protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), RIPK3, MLKL, and P-MLKL, were assessed by western blot  analyses. The cultured primary mouse OPCs were used to confirm the effects of  Nec-1 on the viability of OPCs following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). This  study demonstrated that pretreatment with Nec-1 significantly promoted OPCs  survival, alleviated white matter injury, and improved cognitive function after  transient cerebral ischemia. Nec-1 also inhibited the activation of RIPK1, RIPK3,  MLKL, and P-MLKL in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and corpus callosum regions  after MCAO. OPCs' culture experiments confirmed that Nec-1 significantly reduced  the necroptosis of OPCs, perhaps by inhibiting the expression of RIPK1, RIPK3,  MLKL, and P-MLKL. Nec-1, an inhibitor of RIPK1, may reduce ischemic white matter  damage and improve recovery of long-term neurological function following cerebral  ischemia.
