> Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) showed decreased cell viability and increased cell death under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Meanwhile, vital necroptotic  proteins, including receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP) 3 (RIP3) and mixed  lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL), were expressed in the early  stage. The present study aims to explore the effect of necroptosis inhibition on  ADSCs. ADSCs were obtained from normal human subcutaneous fat and verified by  multidirectional differentiation and flow cytometry. By applying cell counting  kit-8 (CCK-8), calcein/propidium iodide (PI) staining and immunostaining, we  determined the OGD treatment time of 4 h, a timepoint when the cells showed a  significant decrease in viability and increased protein expression of RIP3,  phosphorylated RIP3 (pRIP3) and phosphorylated MLKL (pMLKL). After pretreatment  with the inhibitor of RIP3, necroptotic protein expression decreased under OGD  conditions, and cell necrosis decreased. Transwell assays proved that cell  migration ability was retained. Furthermore, the expression of the adipogenic  transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and  quantitative analysis of Oil Red O staining increased in the inhibitor group. The  expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) and fibroblast growth  factor 2 (FGF2) and the migration test suggest that OGD increases the secretion  of vascular factors, promotes the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial  cells (HUVECs), and forms unstable neovascularization. ELISA revealed that  inhibition of RIP3 increased the secretion of the anti-inflammatory factor,  interleukin (IL)-10 (IL-10) and reduced the expression of the proinflammatory  factor IL-1β. Inhibition of RIP3 can reduce the death of ADSCs, retain their  migration ability and adipogenic differentiation potential, reduce unstable  neovascularization and inhibit the inflammatory response.

> utologous fat transplantation (AFT) has been widely used in recent years. This technique is favored in aesthetic and reconstructive surgeries because of its comprehensive source of adipose tissue, relatively simple access, and minimal invasion [1–3]. However, the sizeable long-term graft survival rate fluctuation and lack of corresponding intervention methods limit its further development and clinical application [4–7]. Based on the three-zone theory, the intermediate and central areas of the graft were under hypoxia and ischemia. It took approximately 1–3 months to promote angiogenesis and reconstruct the capillary network. Therefore, a lack of oxygen and glucose induces cell death of adipocytes and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) at an early age [8].

> In 2008, Yoshimura et al. were the first to clearly describe the cell-assisted lipotransfer (CAL) technique in AFT [9,10]. Since then, many articles have studied the use of stromal cells or mesenchymal stem cells in standard lipofilling and have found slight variations and promising results [11].

> FT technology is widely used in cosmetic and reconstructive surgery with continuous development. However, the instability of graft retention limits the further development, popularization, and application of this technology [21–23]. The theoretical basis of AFT mainly includes graft survival theory and graft replacement theory [24]. Yoshimura, one of the supporters of graft replacement theory, presented that the reconstruction of recipient capacity mainly benefits from the replacement of adipose stem/progenitor cells in the ischemic necrosis area [8,25]. In addition, he first proposed CAL with the stromal vascular fraction as an auxiliary ingredient, and scholars have successfully improved fat retention by mixing ADSCs into fat grafts, whereas controversies regarding CAL still exist [11,26–30]. The central area of the graft was in an extreme state of ischemia and hypoxia, the oxygen partial pressure was only approximately 15 mmHg, and neovascularization required up to 2–3 weeks [8]. Reducing the impact of extreme environments and

> With the development of graft replacement theory, recent studies have demonstrated that ADSCs promote the migration of endothelial cells, maintain the stability of neovascularization [35–37] and increase the proliferation of new adipocytes [35]. In addition, ADSCs inhibited the inflammatory response in the graft’s nonperipheral area and reduced the degree of necrosis by secreting inflammatory regulators [36,37]. The effects above indirectly suggested the possible mechanism by which ADSCs promote the survival of fat grafts. As the contribution of ADSCs to graft retention may be underlied in migration, adipogenesis, angiogenesis, and inflammatory regulation, we used GSK′872, an effective and specific inhibitor of RIP3, to modulate these activities by inhibiting the kinase.

> ADSCs have the ability to undergo adipogenic differentiation, which is mainly regulated by PPARγ. PPARγ mediates the change in the epigenetic transition state of precursor adipocytes and maintains the gene expression of mature adipocytes [35,40–42]. The expression of PPARγ in the GSK′872 group was higher than that in the OGD group, which was consistent with the semiquantitative results of Oil Red O staining in adipogenic differentiation, suggesting that GSK′872 might protect the adipogenic potential of ADSCs by up-regulating PPARγ. To date, no evidence has been presented to prove the connection between necroptosis and adipogenesis, which indicated another underlying pathway beneath the positive interrelation of GSK′872 and PPARγ. A recent study demonstrated that GSK′872 regulated PPARγ in macrophages, possibly through the ROS-caspase 1 pathway [43]. As caspase-1 mediated cleavage and impaired the transcriptional activity of PPARγ, a higher concentration of caspase-1-dependent IL-1β in the OGD group from our ELISA results further indicated the possibility of enhanced PPARγ induced by inhibition of RIP3. PPARG further modulated the downstream end-stage adipogenic genes as a vital transcript factor, resulting in smaller droplet formation within ADSCs under OGD than ADSCs pretreated with GSK′872, consistent with the Oil Red O analysis [35,40,42,44,45].

> ppropriate OGD culture conditions in vitro imitated the possible environment of ADSCs in vivo. Through GSK′872 intervention in necroptosis, ADSCs enhanced resistance to an extremely hypoxic glucose-free state, improved cell viability, and modified the competency of adipogenesis, angiogenesis, and inflammation regulation. This put forward a more promising hypothesis for improving the efficiency of CAL and promoting fat retention.
