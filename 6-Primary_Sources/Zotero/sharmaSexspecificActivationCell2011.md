> Neuronal death pathways following hypoxia-ischaemia are sexually dimorphic, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We examined cell death mechanisms during OGD (oxygen-glucose deprivation) followed by Reox (reoxygenation) in segregated male (XY) and female (XX) mouse primary CGNs (cerebellar granule neurons) that are WT (wild-type) or Parp-1 [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1] KO (knockout). Exposure of CGNs to OGD (1.5 h)/Reox (7 h) caused cell death in XY and XX neurons, but cell death during Reox was greater in XX neurons. ATP levels were significantly lower after OGD/Reox in WT-XX neurons than in XY neurons; this difference was eliminated in Parp-1 KO-XX neurons. AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) was released from mitochondria and translocated to the nucleus by 1 h exclusively in WT-XY neurons. In contrast, there was a release of Cyt C (cytochrome C) from mitochondria in WT-XX and Parp-1 KO neurons of both sexes; delayed activation of caspase 3 was observed in the same three groups. Thus deletion of Parp-1 shunted cell death towards caspase 3-dependent apoptosis. Delayed activation of caspase 8 was also observed in all groups after OGD/Reox, but was much greater in XX neurons, and caspase 8 translocated to the nucleus in XX neurons only. Caspase 8 activation may contribute to increased XX neuronal death during Reox, via caspase 3 activation. Thus, OGD/Reox induces death of XY neurons via a PARP-1-AIF-dependent mechanism, but blockade of PARP-1-AIF pathway shifts neuronal death towards a caspase-dependent mechanism. In XX neurons, OGD/Reox caused prolonged depletion of ATP and delayed activation of caspase 8 and caspase 3, culminating in greater cell death during Reox.

> Sex specificity studies of HI brain injury, both in vivo and in vitro, studies suggest that mechanisms of ischaemic cell death are not identical between male and female sexed cells (Carruth et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2003; Du et al., 2004; Renolleau et al., 2008), supporting the notion that divergent pathways of cell death occur between chromosomal sexes (Hall et al., 1991; Nunez et al., 2001).

> The present study provides strong evidence of sex differences in neuronal injury in segregated XY and XX primary CGNs at the Reox phase after a period of OGD exposure. First, OGD triggered mitochondrial release of AIF, a major triggering event for large-scale DNA fragmentation and neuronal death, at a much earlier time in XY neurons than in XX neurons. In contrast, cell death in XX neurons proceeded with more pronounced release of Cyt C from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. There was depletion of cellular ATP content following OGD/Reox, and this depletion was much more severe in the XX neurons than in XY neurons, suggesting an increased vulnerability of XX neurons to death (Eguchi et al., 1997). Secondly, significantly higher levels of caspase 3 activation in XX neurons during the Reox phase caused a greater magnitude of cell death in XX neurons than in the XY neurons, as evidenced by a significantly higher percentage of LDH release, TUNEL staining and calcein/PI dye fluorescent staining in XX cells during the Reox phase. Most interestingly, caspase 3 activation was also observed in Parp1-KO cells of both sexes. Thirdly, the XX neurons of both WT  and Parp-1-KO genotype, in contrast with XY neurons, exhibited significantly greater increased activation and nuclear translocation of caspase 8 following OGD/Reox. Most importantly, in contrast with caspase 3 activation, the nuclear localization of caspase 8 occurred in the XX neurons only, which may be responsible for the higher magnitude of XX neuronal death. Together, our results clearly demonstrate the sex specificity in the timing of mitochondrial release of death-initiating factors AIF and Cyt C, and the differential responses of the intrinsic and extrinsic cell death pathways could account for the higher magnitude of neuronal death in XX than in XY neuronal cells during the Reox period after OGD.
