> Mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL)-mediated necroptosis has been implicated in aggravating liver ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury. However, the precise role and mechanism of MLKL in regulating oxidative DNA damage of hepatocytes and subsequent activation of macrophage stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of MLKL in regulating the interplay between hepatocyte injury and macrophage pro-inflammatory responses during liver IR injury. We found that IR increased MLKL expression in liver tissues of wild type (WT) mice. MLKL knockout (KO) attenuated liver IR injury and suppressed the activation of cGAS-STING signaling in intrahepatic macrophages, which was abrogated by STING activation with its agonist. Mechanistically, IR induced oxidative DNA damage in hepatocytes, leading to cGAS-STING activation in macrophages, which was suppressed by MLKL KO. Moreover, increased PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)-mediated mitophagy contributed to reduced oxidative DNA damage in hepatocytes and subsequent decreased activation of STING signaling in macrophages in MLKL KO mice. Our findings demonstrated a non-canonical role of MLKL in the pathogenesis of liver IR. MLKL deficiency significantly promoted PINK1-mediated mitophagy activation to inhibit oxidative DNA damage in hepatocytes, which in turn suppressed macrophage cGAS-STING activation and inflammatory liver IR injury.

[[MLKL has necroptosis-independent functions]]

  **MLKL has an necroptosis unrelated function. The study showed that cGAS-STING showed downregulation in case of MLKL absensence. In my point of view it could be du to decrese necroptosis. This death produce DAMPs that leads to ditection by the macrophages.**

> Necroptosis is a form of regulated cell death mediated by RIP1, RIP3, and MLKL, which play important roles in development, inflammation, and diseases [42]. Necroptosis causes cell membrane rupture and the release of intracellular proinflammatory components [43, 44]. Deletion of RIPK3 or MLKL prevents the extracellular release of necroptotic DAMPs and inflammation [45]. RIPK3-MLKL-dependent necroptosis contributes to ischemia-induced cell death [14] and IR injury in steatotic livers [13, 15]. In contrast, a study also showed that RIPK3 and MLKL expression levels did not change in the liver IR model and Nec1s pretreatment did not protect the liver against IR injury [16]. We have previously shown that aging increases endoplasmic reticulum stress to aggravate hepatocyte necroptosis and liver IR injury [46]. A necroptosis-independent role of MLKL in the regulation of liver diseases has been revealed in recent studies. Emerging evidences have suggested the role of MLKL in regulating immune cells including macrophages. Increased MLKL expression in macrophages was found in ethanol-exposed livers, and myeloid MLKL deficiency exacerbated ethanol-induced steatosis and hepatocyte injury by impairing macrophage phagocytic capability [18]. Inhibition of RIPK1 improves NASH in an MLKL-dependent manner to increase mitochondrial respiration [47]. Critical roles of MLKL in regulating autophagy have been revealed recently. Activated MLKL inhibited autophagy flux in mouse dermal fibroblasts and HT-29 human colorectal cancer cells [48]. Overexpression of MLKL inhibited autophagy flux and activated inflammation in atherosclerosis, which was associated with a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent signaling pathway [49]. In contrast, MLKL activation by CAMK2 was found to promote autophagic flux in mouse Neuro-2a, L929, human HEK293 and  HT29 cells in response to short-term starvation [50]. In livers, MLKL inhibits autophagy to promote hepatocyte cell injury and death during NASH [19]. Similarly, palmitic acid treatment induced the expression and translocation of MLKL to autophagosomes prior to the plasma membrane to inhibit autophagy, and MLKL deficiency restored autophagy activation in hepatocytes [51]. Therefore, dual functions of MLKL have been reported as an autophagy promoter or suppressor, depending on different types of cells, tissues and disease models. In this study, we found that MLKL activation suppressed hepatocyte mitophagy, resulting in macrophage STING activation.

  **Could it be that MLKL somehow ditect DNA damage?**
