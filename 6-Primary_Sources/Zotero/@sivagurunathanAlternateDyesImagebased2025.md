> BACKGROUND: Cell Painting, the leading image-based profiling assay, involves staining plated cells with six dyes that mark the different compartments in a cell. Such profiles can then be used to discover connections between samples (whether different cell lines, different genetic treatments, or different compound treatments) as well as to assess particular features impacted by each treatment. Researchers may wish to vary the standard dye panel to assess particular phenotypes, or image cells live while maintaining the ability to cluster profiles overall.
METHODS: In this study, we evaluate the performance of dyes that can either replace or augment the traditional Cell Painting dyes or enable tracking live cell dynamics. We perturbed U2OS cells with 90 different compounds and subsequently stained them with either standard Cell Painting dyes (Revvity), or with MitoBrilliant (Tocris) replacing MitoTracker or Phenovue phalloidin 400LS (Revvity) replacing phalloidin. We also tested the live-cell compatible ChromaLive dye (Saguaro).
RESULTS: All dye sets effectively separated biological replicates of the same sample vs. negative controls (phenotypic activity), although separating from replicates of all other compounds (phenotypic distinctiveness) proved challenging for all dye sets. While individual dye substitutions within the standard Cell Painting panel had minimal impact on assay performance, the live cell dye exhibited distinct performance profiles across different compound classes compared to the standard panel, with later time points more distinct than earlier ones.
DISCUSSION: Substituting MitoBrilliant or Phenovue phalloidin 400LS for standard mitochondrial or actin dyes minimally impacted Cell Painting assay performance. Phenovue phalloidin 400LS offers the advantage of isolating actin features from Golgi or plasma membrane while accommodating an additional 568 nm dye. Live cell imaging, enabled by ChromaLive dye, provides real-time assessment of compound-induced morphological changes. Combining this with the standard Cell Painting assay significantly expands the feature space for enhanced cellular profiling. Our findings provide data-driven options for researchers selecting dye sets for image-based profiling.

> v) ChromaLive dye, the dead cell marker DRAQ7 and a reagent for detecting the apoptotic cell marker Cas 3/7. Because the last two panels are compatible with live-cell imaging, we captured images at 4 h and 24 h; at 48 h the plate containing ChromaLive only had the Hoechst nuclear dye added and was reimaged. To examine possible changes in morphology induced by live cell imaging [17], the plate containing ChromaLive dye, DRAQ7, and Cas3/7 was re-stained with the standard CP panel so that it could be compared to the standard CP plate. This also tested whether ChromaLive and Cell Painting assays could be performed sequentially for maximum effect.

> We also compared the early timepoint profiles with those obtained from using the ChromaLive features only (dropping the Hoechst features) at the 48 h time point; the 48 h time point shows improved performance over the 24 h time point, though we cannot formally rule out there may be contributions from the presence of the Hoechst dye or microscopy and segmentation differences between the 4 and 24 h vs 48 h timepoints (see Methods). (Figs. 6, 7 Supplementary Figure 5 Supplementary Figure 6). The median mAP values for phenotypic activity using only the ChromaLive dye set are 0.41 at 4 h, 0.53 at 24 h, and 0.64 at 48 h (Fig. 6). While profiling performance generally increased over time, that pattern was not universal across all dye sets (Fig. 6B and Fig. 7B Supplementary Figure 5, Supplementary Figure 6), indicating the utility of a live cell dye where the perturbations may have a stronger impa

> DRAQ7 
  **DRAQ7 offers significant advantages over propidium iodide (PI) as a cell viability dye because it is a far-red fluorescent stain that is non-toxic to cells, can be used in long-term, real-time cell monitoring, and has spectral properties that prevent overlap with other common fluorescent markers.**

> Images were acquired using 20X water objective (NA 1.0) in confocal mode with binning 2 in Opera Phenix Instrument (Revvity). The  following channels were used to image the cells based on the dye sets used - 1. Digital Phase Contrast, 2. Brightfield, 3. Ex/Em 488/650–760, 4. Ex/Em 488/500–550, 5. Ex/Em 561/570–630, 6. Ex/Em 640/ 650–760, 7. Hoechst - Ex/Em 405/435–480, 8. Phenovue 400LS - Ex/Em 405/570–630. The ChromaLive dye can be excited at 488 nm and 561 nm and the resulting fluorescence emission are termed as ChromaLive488_Yellow, ChromaLive488_Red and ChromaLive561_Yellow. In the case of ChromaLive with additional markers, Caspase 3/7 staining was captured along with the ChromaLive 488Y dye component in the same channel during live imaging.
