> Although apoptosis and necrosis are morphologically distind manifes tations of cell death, apoptosis and some necroses share common features in the death signaling pathway involving functional steps of death-driving interleukin 1@i-converting enzyme family proteases and anti-cell death protein Bcl-2. One evident physiological difference in cells undergoing apoptosis vern@snecrosis is in intracellular levels ofATP. In this study, we specifically addressed the question of whether apoptosis depends on in tracellular AlP levels, since longer incubation under ATP-depleting con ditions results in necrotic cell death. Incubation of cells in glucose-free medium with an inhibitor of mitochondrial F@F1-ATPasesreduces intra cellular AlP levels and completely blocks Fas/Apo-1-stimulated apopto ala. AlP supplied through glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation restores the apoptotic cell death pathway. Al? depletion also leads to a block in Faa-induced activation of CPP32/Yama(.like) proteases, and when ATP is depleted after the activation of the proteases, subsequent apoptosis is significantly blocked Thus, ATP-dependent steps exist both upstream and downstream of CPP32IYama(-like)protease activation in apoptotic signal transduction. Treatment with the calcium ionophore induces apoptosis under ATP-supplying conditions but induces necrotic cell death under ATP.depleting conditions, indicating that AlP levels are a determinant of manifestation of cell death.

> Conversion of Apoptotic Signals to Necrotic Signals. Because the apoptotic death signaling pathway contains several AlP-depend ent steps, some of which might determine whether cell death occurs by apoptosis or necrosis, we tested the possibility that apoptosis inducing treatments under Al?-depleting conditions induce necrotic cell death and that Al? dependency is not specific for Fas-induced apoptosis by treating Jurkat cells with other typical apoptosis-induc ing reagents, calcium ionophore (A23187), etoposide, and dexametha sone (22), by manipulating intracellular Al? levels during the treat ments. Treatment with calcium ionophore induced apoptosis under Al?-supplying conditions and necrotic cell death under Al?-deplet ing conditions (Fig. 4). No activation of CPP32IYama(-like) proteases or inhibitory effect of tetrapeptide ICE inhibitor and CPP32/Yama inhibitor was observed in necrotic cell death (data not shown). Ap optosis induced by etoposide and dexamethasone was blocked by Al? depletion, but necrosis was not stimulated (data not shown), possibly due to Al?-dependent reactions that might exist at very early steps in the death signaling pathways induced by these treatments. These results strongly suggest that apoptosis is Al? dependent in general and that cell death fate by apoptosis or necrosis is determined by intracellular Al? levels, at least in the case of calcium ionophore treatment.
