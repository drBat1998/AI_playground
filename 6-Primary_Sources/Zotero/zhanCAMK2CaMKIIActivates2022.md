> MLKL (mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase) is a well-known core component of necrosome that executes necroptotic cell death upon phosphorylation by RIPK3 (receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 3). Recent studies also implicate a role of MLKL in endosomal trafficking, which is not always dependent on RIPK3. Using mouse Neuro-2a and L929 as well as human HEK293 and HT29 cells, we show here that MLKL is phosphorylated in response to serum and amino acid deprivation from the culture medium, in a manner that depends on CAMK2/CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II) but not RIPK3. The starvation-induced increase in MLKL phosphorylation was accompanied by decreases in levels of lipidated MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; LC3-II) and SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1), markers of autophagosomes. These changes were prevented by disrupting either MLKL or CAMK2 by pharmacology and genetic manipulations. Moreover, disrupting MLKL or CAMK2 also inhibited the incorporation of LC3-II into autolysosomes, demonstrating a role of the CAMK2-MLKL pathway in facilitating autophagic flux during short-term starvation, in contrast to necroptosis which suppressed autophagic flux. Furthermore, unlike the necroptotic pathway, the starvation-evoked CAMK2-mediated MLKL phosphorylation protected cells from starvation-induced death. We propose that upon nutrient deprivation, MLKL is activated by CAMK2, which in turn facilitates membrane scission needed for autophagosome maturation, allowing the proper fusion of the autophagosome with lysosome and the subsequent substance degradation. This novel function is independent of RIPK3 and is not involved in necroptosis, implicating new roles for this pseudokinase in cell survival, signaling and metabolism.Abbreviations: CAMK2/CaMKII: calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; DIABLO/SMAC: direct inhibitor of apoptosis-binding protein with low pI/second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase; ECS: extracellular solution; ESCRT: endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GSK3B: glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; HBSS: Hanks' balanced salt solution; KO: knockout; LC3-II: lipidated microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; MLKL: mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: MTOR complex 1; N2a: Neuro-2a neuroblastoma; Nec-1: necrostatin-1; NSA: necrosulfonamide; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PI: propidium iodide; PK-hLC3: pHluorin-mKate2-human LC3; RIPK1: receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 1; RIPK3: receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 3; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RPS6KB1/S6K: ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1; shRNA: short hairpin RNA; siRNA: small interference RNA; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TBS: Tris-buffered saline; TNF/TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor; TSZ, treatment with TNF + DIABLO mimetics + z-VAD-FMK.

> Experimentally, necroptosis is typically triggered by the combined treatment of cells with TNF/TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor), a small-molecule DIABLO/SMAC (diablo IAPbinding mitochondrial protein)-mimetics (such as AZD 5582 dihydrochloride), and a caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-FMK), which  are collectively referred to as TSZ.

> Furthermore, unlike RIPK3induced activation, the CAMK2-mediated MLKL phosphorylation does not mediate cell death, but instead, it exerts a positive role in autophagic flux by facilitating autolysosome formation and consequently the degradation of autophagosome cargoes.

> We show that CAMK2 and RIPK3 represent two independent pathways that trigger MLKL phosphorylation. First, whereas inhibiting CAMK2 with pharmacological blockers or genetic disruption only abolished the starvation-induced MLKL phosphorylation, that of RIPK1 or RIPK3 only suppressed the necroptotic activation of MLKL. Second, while the CAMK2-mediated MLKL activation initiated within 0.5–1 h of serum and amino acid starvation and then dissipated within a few hours, the RIPK3-mediated MLKL phosphorylation begins to appear within 3–6 h after the addition of TSZ and lasts for at least 12 h [3,42–44]. Third, the CAMK2mediated MLKL activation facilitates autophagic flux, as revealed by the dependence on both MLKL and CAMK2 of the starvation-induced acceleration of autophagosomelysosome fusion and degradation of LC3-II and SQSTM1.

> Finally, in contrast to its well-known function in necroptotic death, MLKL appeared to be pro-survival under starvation, as shown by the increased death of mlkl KO cells subject to serum and amino acid starvation. Therefore, depending on how it is activated, MLKL exerts opposite functions on cell fate, with the CAMK2-MLKL link being supportive of survival under nutrient-deprived conditions and the RIPK1-RIPK3MLKL pathway utilized to trigger cell death in necroptosis.

> CAMK2D has been reported to exist in the necrosome complex and serve as a substrate of RIPK3 [46,47]. As such, CAMK2 can be activated downstream from RIPK3 and this may explain why the presence of RIPK3 caused faster and longer-lasting MLKL phosphorylation upon starvation. However, it remains to be determined whether CAMK2D also contributes to starvation-induced MLKL activation. We focused on CAMK2A in the current study because siRNA knockdown of CAMK2A abolished the starvation-induced MLKL phosphorylation and recombinant CAMK2A not only interacted with MLKL but also supported its phosphorylation. However, the protein size detected by the anti-p-CAMK2 antibody, which likely recognizes all CAMK2 isoforms, matches that of CAMK2A and CAMK2D, which are both broadly distributed [48]. CAMK2D has been demonstrated to mediate RIPK1-independent cell death, downstream from RIPK3, through opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and dissipating mitochondrial membrane potential [46,47]. Whether CAMK2A carries a similar function is unclear. Therefore, the involvement of different CAMK2 isoforms in starvation- and RIPK3-dependent pathways needs further investigation.

> The role of MLKL in endosomal trafficking has been suggested by a number of recent studies [10,40,41]. MLKL is found to be associated with endosomes, including early and late endosomes, autophagosomes, as well as intraluminal vesicles and peripheral membranes of multivesicular bodies; deletion of MLKL impaired endocytic uptake and degradation of TNF and EGF (epidermal growth factor), as well as their receptors [10], while causing lipid accumulation in cells [40]. MLKL was also found on phagophore membranes in complex with pro-apoptotic or necroptotic proteins (FADD, RIPK1, RIPK3, and CASP8) and autophagy proteins (ATG5, ATG7, and SQSTM1) in HIV-1-infected macrophages treated with SMAC mimetics that induce autophagy-dependent apoptosis [56]. More importantly, a RIPK3-independent function for MLKL in intraluminal vesicle formation and subsequent extracellular vesicle release has been postulated to involve a role in membrane budding into the luminal side of endosomes and multivesicular bodies [10]. This action requires MLKL association with ESCRT complexes [10,13], membrane-scission machineries that function in sorting cargo proteins into intraluminal vesicles and many other aspects of vesicular trafficking [57–59].

> Topologically, the autophagosome resembles a multivesicular body with a single intraluminal vesicle [60]. As in intraluminal vesicle scission, the ESCRT complexes are reported to perform similar functions in phagophore closure [36,59,61,62], a critical final step of autophagosome maturation that involves sealing the opening ends of the expanded phagophore for the separation of inner and outer membranes of the autophagosome [63]. As a part of the concerted action of the ESCRT-III complex, MLKL may also participate in phagophore closure. Importantly, the failure to seal off the newly formed autophagosome severely impairs autophagic flux [61,64], similarly as we observed in cells with MLKL inhibited by its inhibitors or genetic disruption. Therefore, we speculate that MLKL may facilitate autophagic flux by supporting autophagosome maturation during ESCRTmediated membrane scission that separates the inner and outer autophagosome membranes, a step crucial for functional autolysosome formation and the proper degradation of autophagosomal cargoes.
