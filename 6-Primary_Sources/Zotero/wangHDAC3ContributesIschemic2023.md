> BACKGROUND: The inflammation and immune response contribute to ischemic stroke pathology. Damaged brain cells release inflammatory substances to activate the immune system in the acute phase of stroke, including altering the interferon signaling pathway. However, the involvement of histone deacetylation in stroke remains unclear.
METHODS: To investigate whether histone deacetylation modulation could regulate the interferon signaling pathway and mediate the pathogenic changes after stroke, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model was treated with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibitor and RGFP966. Additionally, a series of approaches, including middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blot, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, behavioral experiments, and confocal imaging were utilized.
RESULTS: It is observed that RGFP966 pretreatment could lead to better outcomes in the MCAO mouse model, including the decrease of infarction volumes, the amelioration of post-stroke anxiety-like behavior, and the relief of inflammatory responses. Furthermore, we found that RGFP966 could counteract the hyperactivation of the interferon signaling pathway and the excessive expression of Z-DNA Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1) in microglia.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a novel mechanism that HDAC3 inhibition could ameliorate the pathological injury after ischemic stroke by downregulating the ZBP1/phosphorylated Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (p-IRF3) pathway. Thus, these data provide a new promising target for therapies for ischemic stroke.

> HDACs, also known as histone deacetylases, are a class of essential epigenetic regulator enzymes. HDACs can remove the acetyl group from the target protein’s lysineamino group, thereby changing the activity of the protein or affecting gene transcription. Eighteen different HDACs have been discovered in eukaryotes, categorized into two groups based on their active mechanisms: classical HDACs and non-classical HDACs. Notably, the deacetylation activity of classical HDACs (classes I, II, and IV) depends on the metal ion Zn2+. At the same time, non-classical HDACs (Sirtuins, SIRTs) are dependent on the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) [6]. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) can modulate histone acetylation or deacetylation and regulate cell survival, immunity, and inflammation [7]. Additionally, HDAC3 is crucial in maintaining neuronal plasticity, memory formation, and inflammatory response post-stroke. A robust expression of HDAC3 has been observed in neurons and glia after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) [8,9].

> Here, we proposed that HDAC3 could regulate the expression/activity of ZBP1 and that the HDAC3-ZBP1pIRF3 signaling pathway plays a vital role in ischemic brain injury.

> ZBP1 can also be activated by host-derived nucleic acid receptors and damaged mtDNA [35]. In our study, the elevated expression of ZBP1 was detected three days after ischemia-reperfusion injury in the brain.
