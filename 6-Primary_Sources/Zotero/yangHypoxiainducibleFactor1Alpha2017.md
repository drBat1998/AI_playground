> Necroptosis, a novel type of programmed cell death, is involved in stroke-induced ischemic brain injury. Although studies have sought to explore the mechanisms of  necroptosis, its signaling pathway has not yet to be completely elucidated. Thus,  we used oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and middle cerebral artery occlusion  (MCAO) models mimicking ischemic stroke (IS) conditions to investigate mechanisms  of necroptosis. We found that OGD and MCAO induced cell death, local brain  ischemia and neurological deficit, while zVAD-fmk (zVAD, an apoptotic inhibitor),  GSK'872 (a receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIP3) inhibitor), and combined  treatment alleviated cell death and ischemic brain injury. Moreover, OGD and MCAO  upregulated protein expression of the triggers of necroptosis: receptor  interacting protein kinase-1 (RIP1), RIP3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like  protein (MLKL). The upregulation of these proteins was inhibited by GSK'872,  combination treatments and RIP3 siRNA but not zVAD treatment. Intriguingly,  hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), an important transcriptional factor  under hypoxic conditions, was upregulated by OGD and MCAO. Similar to their  inhibitory effects on aforementioned proteins upregulation, GSK'872, combination  treatments and RIP3 siRNA decreased HIF-1α protein level. These findings indicate  that necroptosis contributes to ischemic brain injury induced by OGD and MCAO and  implicate HIF-1α, RIP1, RIP3, and MLKL in necroptosis.

> HIF-1α is an important transcriptional factor that is stabilized by intercellular hypoxic environments. HIF-1α  regulates the transcription of more than 100 downstream hypoxia and ischemia genes29 and participates in complicated post-IS ischemic brain injury processes, including oxidative stress, cell death, adaptive response and  regeneration30. However, whether HIF-1α plays a neuroprotective role or not is still controversial. Some studies  show that HIF-1α inhibition reversed the beneficial effects of valproate31. Other studies indicate that edaravone ameliorated hippocampal CA1 injury and neural stem/progenitor cells death by inhibiting ROS generation and  HIF-1α expression. ROS generation has been shown to play a vital role in the activation of HIF-1α32, suggesting  that ROS-dependent HIF-1α activation results in cell death after cerebral ischemia33. Moreover, the suppression of HIF-1α by baicalein is mediated by inhibiting ROS generation and PI3-kinase/Akt activation, which suggests that ROS acts as an upstream regulator of HIF-1α accumulation and stabilization34. In the present study, we observed ischemic injury improvement and RIP1, RIP3, MLKL and phosphorylated MLKL reduction following GSK’872 treatment and RIP3 siRNA transfection, which coincided with the downregulation of HIF-1α. Moreover, HIF-1α siRNA attenuated the ischemic injury but didn’t affect the protein expression of RIP3, MLKL and phosphorylated MLKL in vitro, which suggests that, on one hand, the accumulation of HIF-1α in hypoxic conditions had an adverse effect on in vitro and in vivo IS pathological process in agreement with previous reports. On the other hand, HIF-1α may be the downstream effector and indirectly implicated in necroptosis which deteriorated ischemic brain injury. Considering previous studies and our data, we propose that the relationship between HIF-1α and necroptosis may be facilitated by ROS, which participates in the activation of HIF-1α and regulation of necroptosis. Little is known about HIF-1α molecular mechanisms involved in necroptotic signaling in IS, but recent reports indicate that alterations of mitochondrial function and ROS generation are mediators of RIP kinases-dependent  necroptosis35, 36. Huang CY et al. documented that RIP-dependent necroptosis induced by hypoxia was eliminated by glucose and pyruvate, which prevented mitochondrial ROS generation and attenuated RIP1 and RIP3 interaction. These glucose and pyruvate effects ultimately led to necroptosis resistance and morphological recovery by  hypoxic-damaged cells, indicating that ROS generation contributed to necroptotic process induced by hypoxia37. Moreover, Yuan L et al. demonstrated that OGD treatment induced necroptotic cell death, increased levels of ROS and neuronal oxidative stress-associated histone deacetylase 6, and histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor diminished  OGD-induced necroptosis by inhibiting ROS generation38. Those results suggest that ROS may play a crucial role in necroptosis regulation.

> Cell culture. Murine hippocampal neuronal HT-22 cells were obtained from HuiYing Biological Technology (Shanghai, China) and cultured with Dulbecco’s modified essential medium (DMEM, BasalMedia, Shanghai, China) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, TianHang biotech, Huzhou, China) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was refreshed every 2 days, and cell passages were performed at 90% confluence. The cells were cultured conventionally for 7 days before experiments were performed.

> Transient transfections of RIP3 and HIF-1α siRNA. HT-22 cells were cultured under normal growth condition for 24 h prior to transfection. SiRNAs targeting mouse RIP3 (AuGCT, Beijing, China) and HIF-1α (AuGCT, Beijing, China) were synthesized with the following sequences: 5′-TGG CAC TCC TCA GAT TCC ACA TAC T-3′ and 5′-AAG CAU UUC UCU CAU UUC CUC AUG G-3′, respectively. Nontargeting siRNA with the sequence 5′-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG U-3′ was used as blank control. After incubated with  Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA) in Opti-MEM (BasalMedia, Shanghai, China) for 20 minutes at  room temperature, the siRNAs were transferred into HT-22 cells for 24 h in normoxic environment. Then the transfected cells were arranged to conduct OGD model.
