> Since several different pathways are involved in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, combination therapy rather than monotherapy may be required for efficient  neuroprotection. In this study, we examined the protective effects of an  apoptosis inhibitor Gly(14)-humanin (HNG) and a necroptosis inhibitor  necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) on hypoxia/ischemia/reperfusion injury. Cultured mouse  primary cortical neurons were incubated with Nec-1, HNG or both in a hypoxia  chamber for 60 min. Cell viability was determined by MTS assay at 24h after  oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment. Mice underwent middle cerebral artery  occlusion for 75 min followed by 24h reperfusion. Mice were administered HNG  and/or Nec-1 (i.c.v.) at 4h after reperfusion. Neurological deficits were  evaluated and the cerebral infarct volume was determined by TTC staining. Nec-1  or HNG alone had protective effects on OGD-induced cell death. Combined treatment  with Nec-1 and HNG resulted in more neuroprotection than Nec-1 or HNG alone.  Treatment with HNG or Nec-1 reduced cerebral infarct volume from 59.3 ± 2.6% to  47.0 ± 2.3% and 47.1 ± 1.5%, respectively. Combined treatment with HNG and Nec-1  improved neurological scores and decreased infarct volume to 38.6 ± 1.5%. In  summary, we demonstrated that the combination treatment of HNG and Nec-1  conferred synergistic neuroprotection on hypoxia/ischemia/reperfusion injury in  vitro and in vivo. These findings provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the  treatment of stroke by combining anti-apoptosis and anti-necroptosis therapy.

> n a previous study, we showed that Nec-1 protects against glutamate-induced necroptosis in hippocampal HT-22 cells (Xu et al., 2007 
  **So necroptosis could be related to exitotoxicity?**

  **While HNG and Nec-1 showed neuroprotective properties, the article's author doesn't determine the specific death type.**

> Primary mouse cortical neuron culture and the induction of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)  Embryonic day 16-18 mice were obtained from anesthetized pregnant CD-1 mice. Skin, skull, and meninges were carefully removed and cerebral cortices were isolated from the mouse brains. Cerebral cortices were dissociated with papain (8.2 U/ml, Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) for 30 min at 37°C. Fetal bovine serum and trypsin inhibitor were used to stop the digestion. Tissues were then triturated with a Pasteur pipette. Freshly  dissociated cells were seeded at 2×105 cells/cm2 into 96-well plastic plates coated with Lpolyornithine (10 μg/ml) and incubated in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 2% B-27 supplement, Glutamax (1:100) (Invitrogen), penicillin, and streptomycin at 37°C. The medium was changed 24 h after plating and half of the medium was changed every 3 d. OGD experiments were conducted on the DIV 10. Immunohistochemical analysis of neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5 (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) revealed that the neurons were 90% pure. Neurons in 96well plate were rinsed with 1x Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen) containing 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 30 μM glycine, pH 7.4. Cultured  cortical neurons were incubated with HNG (0.2 μM) and/or Nec-1 (25 μM) in pre-gassed HBSS buffer and then the plate was placed in a Billups-Rothenberg modular incubator chamber (Del Mar, CA), flushed with a mixed gas of 5% CO2 and 95% N2 for 10 min. The  chamber was then sealed and placed into a humidified incubator at 37°C. After 60 min in the hypoxic chamber, the OGD treatment was stopped by replacing HBSS with Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 containing HNG and/or Nec-1. The plate was placed back to normoxic conditions and incubated for 24 h for the cell viability determination. Control culture plate was exposed to oxygenated HBSS containi

> Cell viability assay  Cell viability was assessed by the ability of the viable cells to metabolize 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)2-H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS), as described previously (Cory et al., 1991). At 24 h after OGD treatment, 10 μl of MTS solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well, and the cells were maintained in the growth medium for 3 h at 37°C. Absorbance was subsequently measured at 490 nm. Untreated cells were considered as the control, and the growth medium without cells in the presence of MTS solution was used as a solution background. Cell viability was calculated as the percentage of the untreated controls. For the MTS assay, there were eight samples in each group, and the experiment was repeated at least 3 times.

> The mechanism by which HNG achieves these effects involves decreasing cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP, a marker of caspase activity), inhibiting extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) activation (Xu et al., 2006a), and activating PI3K/Akt signal pathways (Xu et al., 2008). 
  **Does the PARP associated with apoptosis?**
