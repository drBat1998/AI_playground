> Recent developments, both in caspase research and in neurophysiology, indicate that caspase-3 is important not only in apoptosis but also in physiological processes that do not cause cell death

> Although the above-mentioned deficient mice show a defective neuronal apoptosis and a dramatic brain phenotype, Apaf1-deficient mice show more profound malformations than those observed in other mutants. This observation suggests that Apaf1 may be involved in apoptotic pathways other than those involving caspase-3 or caspase-9 activation. Mutation of Apaf1, but not of caspase-3 or caspase-9, results in a delay in the removal of embryonic interdigital webs and also in abnormal eye development. Furthermore, as in the case of  caspase-9 deficiency, Apaf1 / cells are resistant to a wide variety of apoptotic stimuli, but not to death receptor-mediated killing. Cytochrome c knock-in embryonic cells are more resistant to apoptosis induced by UV irradiation, serum starvation or staurosporin.

> hey generated clonally derived neurospheres from the striatum of E14.5 murine embryos and observed a significant increase in caspase-3 activity during neurosphere differentiation. Interestingly, despite caspase-3 activity increase, no cleavage of PARP (a caspase-3 nuclear substrate cleaved during apoptosis) was observed and the caspase-3 inhibition with z-DEVD-fmk did not affect apoptosis during neurosphere differentiation, suggesting that caspase-3 activity during neurogenesis is not associated with cell death 
  **Fernando et al.30 suggest that it is involved in neural stem cell differentiation and not only in cell death.**

> This elimination, both during development and in adult tissue, can be divided into two classes: small-scale events (elimination of synaptic connections and the local pruning of an axonal or dendritic arbor) and largescale events (elimination of a significant length of the primary axon and of major axon collaterals).31

> (1) many proteins that have a fundamental role in neuronal plasticity are caspase-3 substrates;35 (2) in vivo and in vitro findings indicate the involvement of caspase-3 in the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory.36

> The in vivo experiments that we report below use z-DEVDfmk to inhibit caspase-3. It should be borne in mind that, although z-DEVD-fmk is the best inhibitor known for caspase3, it also inhibits other proteases (other caspases and noncaspases) when applied in high concentrations. 
  **Good example if I would be going in discussion what is the best way to inhibit some molecules, pharmacological or genetic.**

> ‘Evidence for Synaptic Apoptosis’37 is the first study to show that apoptosis-related biochemical alterations can occur locally in synapses and dendrites of cultured neurons independently of the cell body. Mattson et al.37 showed the ability of glutamate to induce caspase-3 activation in dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting a role of local caspase-3 activity in synaptic and dendritic degenerative processes.

> Mattson et al.37 observed dendritic localization of activated caspase-3 in cultured hippocampal neurons. However, Huesmann and Clayton39 have shown for the first time that activated caspase-3 is present, in vivo, in the postsynaptic terminal of neurons in the auditory forebrain of zebra finch (the most common and familiar small passerine bird of central Australia). In addition, they observed that caspase-3 activity is necessary for the development of long-term habituation to a song, as shown using caspase-3 inhibitor.

> At the electrophysiological level, Gulyaeva et al.41 showed that caspase-3 activity is required for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of rat hippocampus. The authors did not identify the precise molecular mechanism of caspase-3 involvement in LTP, although they do support the concept of the role of caspase-3 in synaptic plasticity. This result is not surprising if we consider the caspase-3 potential degradative targets in the synapse, including structural and signaling proteins.35

> Recently, Arama et al.43 showed that a cullin-3-based enzyme complex (cullins are known to target proteins for degradation) is required for caspase activation during sperm differentiation in Drosophila. Their results suggest that a specific cullin-3 enzyme complex activates caspases by degrading caspase inhibitors.

> An important role for caspase-3 in synapse degeneration is suggested by Louneva et al.64 The authors found, in both control and AD cases, a selective enrichment of caspase-3 at synapses, particularly in the postsynaptic compartment. Moreover, AD patients exhibited significant increases in synaptic procaspase-3 and active caspase-3 expression levels compared with age-matched controls. These findings encourage to study the molecular mechanisms by which active caspase-3 might lead to progressive synaptic degeneration and ultimately to synaptic loss, the best pathological correlate of cognitive decline in AD.65
