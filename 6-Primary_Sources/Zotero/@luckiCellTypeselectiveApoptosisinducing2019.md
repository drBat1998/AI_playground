> Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; grade IV astrocytoma) is the most prevalent and aggressive form of primary brain cancer. A subpopulation of multipotent cells termed GBM cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a critical role in tumor initiation, tumor maintenance, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence following surgery. Here we report the identification of a small molecule, termed RIPGBM, from a cell-based chemical screen that selectively induces apoptosis in multiple primary patient-derived GBM CSC cultures. The cell type-dependent selectivity of this compound appears to arise at least in part from redox-dependent formation of a proapoptotic derivative, termed cRIPGBM, in GBM CSCs. cRIPGBM induces caspase 1-dependent apoptosis by binding to receptor-interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) and acting as a molecular switch, which reduces the formation of a prosurvival RIPK2/TAK1 complex and increases the formation of a proapoptotic RIPK2/caspase 1 complex. In an orthotopic intracranial GBM CSC tumor xenograft mouse model, RIPGBM was found to significantly suppress tumor formation in vivo. Our chemical genetics-based approach has identified a drug candidate and a potential drug target that provide an approach to the development of treatments for this devastating disease.

> The highly infiltrative nature of GBM tumors is attributed to the ability of GBM CSCs to migrate within the brain, a feature also shared with NSCs (13). Further, GBM CSCs are thought to contribute to drug resistance (14, 15) and have even been demonstrated to have the potential to give rise to endothelial cells that enable tumor vascularization (16). Thus, efforts to develop new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of GBM have recently focused on targeting this stem cell population (17).

  **The author use luciferase-based survival assay to identify compounds that selectively toxic to chemoresistant GBM CSCs. Than cytotoxicity was ditermine by cell counting using sveral GBM CSC lines, and nondisease cell lines to ditermine specicificity.  Followed by a caspase 3/7 activation assay.**

> Compound treatment (250 nM) resulted in a time-dependent activation of caspase 1, caspase 9, and caspase 7, as well as PARP cleavage (Fig. 3A), providing further evidence that cRIPGBM induces cell death via an apoptotic mechanism. Correspondingly, the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK significantly reduced compound-mediated GBM CSC death (Fig. 3B). 

Glioblastoma multiforme cancer stem cells contribute to the highly infiltrative nature of the tumor, its resistance to drugs, and the promotion of tumor vascularization. The aim of the authors is use the high-throughput approach to identify a small molecule that induces selective cell death in GBM CSC cultures called RIPGBM. RIPGBM specifically transforms into cRIPGBM form inside GBM CSC and induces cell death through RIPK2 and CASP1. Although they use an interesting toolkit, they do not use any specific necrotic marker, which could help distinguish apoptosis, as they claimed, from pyroptosis.
