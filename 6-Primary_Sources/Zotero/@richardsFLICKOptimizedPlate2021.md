> Evaluating drug sensitivity is improved by directly quantifying death kinetics, rather than correlates of viability, such as metabolic activity. This is challenging, requiring time-lapse microscopy and genetically encoded labels to distinguish live and dead cells. Here, we describe fluorescence-based and lysis-dependent inference of cell death kinetics (FLICK). This method requires only a standard fluorescence plate reader, retaining the high-throughput nature and broad accessibility of common viability assays. However, FLICK specifically quantifies death, including an accurate inference of death kinetics. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Richards et al. (2020).

  **Kinetic analysis: quantification of dead cell over time; Quantification of live cell fluorescence at assay endpoint;Population size at any intermediate time point is estimated based on the experimentally observed population size at the beginning and end of the assay.Lethal fraction (LF) kinetics for SGI-1027. Unlike dead cell fluorescence, LF reveals dose-dependent increase in drug efficacy. (E and F) Kinetic parameters from the LED analysis. (E) Death onset time (DO) at each tested dose of SGI-1027. Camptothecin shown for comparison. (F) Death rate (DR) at each tested dose of SGI-1027. Camptothecin shown for comparison. For (A) and (D)–(F), data are mean G SD of 4 biological replicates. For (F) and (G), dose ranges tested were half-log dilutions starting at 31.6 mM. If death was not significantly above baseline values at the assay endpoint, rates were not calculated (n.a., not applicable).**
