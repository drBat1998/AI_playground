> Alzheimer's disease (AD), the major cause of dementia, affects the elderly population worldwide. Previous studies have shown that depletion of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) expression reverted the AD phenotype in murine AD models. Necroptosis, executed by mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein and activated by RIPK1 and RIPK3, has been shown to be involved in AD. However, the role of RIPK1 in beta-amyloid (Aβ)-induced necroptosis is not yet fully understood. In this study, we explored the role of RIPK1 in the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells treated with Aβ 1-40 or Aβ 1-42. We showed that Aβ-induced neuronal cell death was independent of apoptosis and autophagy pathways. Further analyses depicted that activation of RIPK1/MLKL-dependant necroptosis pathway was observed in vitro. We demonstrated that inhibition of RIPK1 expression rescued the cells from Aβ-induced neuronal cell death and ectopic expression of RIPK1 was found to enhance the stability of the endogenous APP. In summary, our findings demonstrated that Aβ can potentially drive necroptosis in an RIPK1-MLKL-dependent manner, proposing that RIPK1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD.

> The expression of necroptosis-related proteins was determined  in APP-overexpressed cells. As expected, the protein expression  of RIPK1, p-RIPK1, RIPK3, p-RIPK3, MLKL and p-MLKL showed a  similar expression trend in cells treated with Aβ (Figure 4B), suggesting that Aβ and APP are capable of activating necroptotic-cell  death in AD.

> To further investigate the role of increased caspase-3 activity,  we co-treated the cells with Aβ and caspase inhibitor (Z-Vad) and  the results showed that co-treatment with Z-vad did not significantly improve cell viability. Thus, these findings indicate that the  neurotoxic effect of Aβ is independent of caspase activity. Aside  from apoptosis, activation of caspase-3 has been shown to process  and activate pro-interleukin-16 and stimulate T-lymphocytes.34,35  Perhaps, increased caspase-3 activity in the current study was involved in activating the inflammatory process rather than apoptosis.  On the contrary, autophagy is a bulk degradation pathway for large  and aggregated proteins such as Aβ, and has also been implicated in  AD.36–39 However, current findings show that co-treatment of Aβtreated cells with autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) did not show any rescue effects on cell viability.

> Our findings revealed that the expression levels of  RIPK1, p-RIPK1, MLKL and p-MLKL were increased after exposure  to Aβ. A similar observation was attained from ectopic expression of  APP. Further experiments showed that inhibition of RIPK1 and MLKL  by pharmacological means markedly increased the viability of Aβtreated cells. A similar study reported that both Nec-1 and NSA protected human embryonic stem cell-derived motor neurons (hES-MNs)  from human sporadic ALS astrocyte toxicity.44 Furthermore, inhibition of MLKL by NSA was able to reverse the interleukin-1β-induced  nucleus pulposus cell death, suggesting that NSA could protect intervertebral disc degeneration via necroptosis and apoptosis inhibition.45

> we demonstrated that Aβ-induced neuronal cell death  involves an RIPK1/MLKL-dependent necroptosis mechanism in an in  vitro human AD model. Furthermore, the expression of RIPK1 was  significantly increased in both Aβ-treated and APP-overexpressed  AD cell models. Additionally, inhibition of RIPK1 expression rescued  the cells from Aβ-induced neuronal cell death, whilst ectopic expression of RIPK1 enhanced the stability of endogenous APP. Contrary  to the canonical necroptosis pathway, Aβ-induced RIPK1-MLKLdependent necroptosis is independent of RIPK3 activity. Hence,  these findings suggest that RIPK1 could be a potential target in reversing the pathogenesis of AD.
