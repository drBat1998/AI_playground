> Both reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate (NAD(+)) have been reported to have  potent neuroprotective effects against ischemic neuronal injury. Both NADPH and  NAD(+) are essential cofactors for anti-oxidation and cellular energy metabolism.  We investigated if combined NADPH and NAD(+) could offer better neuroprotective  effects on cellular and animal models of ischemic stroke. In vitro studies with  primary cultured neurons demonstrated that NAD(+) was effective in protecting  neurons against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury when  given during the early time period of reoxygenation. In vivo studies in mice also  suggested that NAD(+) was effective for ameliorating ischemic brain damage when  administered within 2 h after reperfusion. The combination of NADPH and NAD(+)  provided not only greater beneficial effects but also larger therapeutic window  in both cellular and animal models of stroke. The combination of NADPH and NAD(+)  significantly increased the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reduced  the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage of  macromolecules. Furthermore, the combined medication significantly reduced  long-term mortality, improved the functional recovery, and inhibited signaling  pathways involved in apoptosis and necroptosis after ischemic stroke. The present  study indicates that the combination of NAD(+) and NADPH can produce greater  therapeutic effects with smaller dose of NADPH; on the other hand, NADPH can  significantly prolong the therapeutic window of NAD(+). The current results  suggest that the combination of NADPH and NAD(+) may provide a novel effective  therapy for ischemic stroke.

  **NAD and NADH inhibit cell death signial, RIPK3 decrease more or less I could understand, but why the CASP activity decrease as well. Maybe other pathway of apoptosis play some role, for example intrinsic one.**
