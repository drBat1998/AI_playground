> Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) contributes to necroptosis. Our previous study showed that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of RIPK1 protects against ischemic stroke-induced astrocyte injury. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying RIPK1-mediated astrocyte injury in vitro and in vivo. Primary cultured astrocytes were transfected with lentiviruses and then subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). In a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO), lentiviruses carrying shRNA targeting RIPK1 or shRNA targeting heat shock protein 70.1B (Hsp70.1B) were injected into the lateral ventricles 5 days before pMCAO was established. We showed that RIPK1 knockdown protected against OGD-induced astrocyte damage, blocked the OGD-mediated increase in lysosomal membrane permeability in astrocytes, and inhibited the pMCAO-induced increase in astrocyte lysosome numbers in the ischemic cerebral cortex; these results suggested that RIPK1 contributed to the lysosomal injury in ischemic astrocytes. We revealed that RIPK1 knockdown upregulated the protein levels of Hsp70.1B and increased the colocalization of Lamp1 and Hsp70.1B in ischemic astrocytes. Hsp70.1B knockdown exacerbated pMCAO-induced brain injury, decreased lysosomal membrane integrity and blocked the protective effects of the RIPK1-specific inhibitor necrostatin-1 on lysosomal membranes. On the other hand, RIPK1 knockdown further exacerbated the pMCAO- or OGD-induced decreases in the levels of Hsp90 and the binding of Hsp90 to heat shock transcription factor-1 (Hsf1) in the cytoplasm, and RIPK1 knockdown promoted the nuclear translocation of Hsf1 in ischemic astrocytes, resulting in increased Hsp70.1B mRNA expression. These results suggest that inhibition of RIPK1 protects ischemic astrocytes by stabilizing lysosomal membranes via the upregulation of lysosomal Hsp70.1B; the mechanism underlying these effects involves decreased Hsp90 protein levels, increased Hsf1 nuclear translocation and increased Hsp70.1B mRNA expression.

> Our previous studies demonstrated that RIPK1/RIPK3 activation mediates astrocyte necroptosis in rat models of permanent middle cerebral occlusion (pMCAO) and in astrocytes subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced injury, and the underlying mechanisms include RIPK1 inducing lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) and cathepsin B release from lysosomes into the cytoplasm in ischemic astrocytes [15]. However, it is unclear how RIPK1 increases LMP.

> n monkey hippocampal CA1 neurons subjected to ischemia–reperfusion insult, Sahara et al. demonstrated that Hsp70.1 is carbonylated by artificial oxidative stressors, such as hydroxynonenal or hydrogen peroxide, and carbonylated Hsp70.1 in CA1 tissues is much more vulnerable to calpain cleavage [24]. Therefore, Hsp70.1 is a modulator of lysosomal rupture/permeabilization after ischemia–reperfusion injury

> A large number of studies have shown that Hsp90 plays an important role in the stability and normal function of RIPK1 [26–28]. Activated molecular chaperone complexes composed of Hsp90 and CDC37 regulate the formation of RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL complexes, therefore, regulating necroptosis in cells, and Hsp90 inhibitors can inhibit the occurrence of necroptosis [29, 30].

Primary cortical astrocyte cultures were prepared from 24 h postnatal SD rats as previously described [16]. Briefly, the cerebral cortices were digested with 2.5% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C and filtered through a sterile 40 μm nylon cell strainer. The cells were suspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 (1:1) (11330, Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (10099, Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (C0222, Beyotime, China) solution. The cells were maintained at 37 °C under >90% humidity in 5% CO2. The medium was changed every 2–3 days until the cells reached confluence. The population of cells obtained with this procedure included more than 95% astrocytes, which were positive for glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) staining.
