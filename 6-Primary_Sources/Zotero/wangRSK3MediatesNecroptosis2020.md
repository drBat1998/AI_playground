> Receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) plays an important role in the necroptosis signaling pathway. Our previous studies have shown that the RIP3/mixed lineage  kinase domain-like protein (MLKL)-mediated necroptosis occurs in retinal ganglion  cell line 5 (RGC-5) following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). However, upstream  regulatory pathways of RIP3 are yet to be uncovered. The purpose of the present  study was to investigate the role of p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 3 (RSK3) in  the phosphorylation of RIP3 in RGC-5 cell necroptosis following OGD. Our results  showed that expression of RSK3, RIP3, and MLKL was upregulated in necroptosis of  RGC-5 after OGD. A computer simulation based on our preliminary results indicated  that RSK3 might interact with RIP3, which was subsequently confirmed by  co-immunoprecipitation. Further, we found that the application of a specific RSK  inhibitor, LJH685, or rsk3 small interfering RNA (siRNA), downregulated the  phosphorylation of RIP3. However, the overexpression of rip3 did not affect the  expression of RSK3, thereby indicating that RSK3 could be a possible upstream  regulator of RIP3 phosphorylation in OGD-induced necroptosis of RGC-5 cells.  Moreover, our in vivo results showed that pretreatment with LJH685 before acute  high intraocular pressure episodes could reduce the necroptosis of retinal  neurons and improve recovery of impaired visual function. Taken together, our  findings suggested that RSK3 might work as an upstream regulator of RIP3  phosphorylation during RGC-5 necroptosis.

> Earlier studies as well as  our own previous work have shown that, other than in non-neuronal cells, necroptosis also occurs in many types of neurons, such as  retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following acute retinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R; Rosenbaum et al., 2010; Liao et al., 2017; Huang et al.,  2013), oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)/glutamate-induced neuronal injury (Zhang et al., 2013a; 2013b; Wang et al., 2018a; 2018b;  2018c; 2018d; Mathew et al., 2019; 2019a; 2019b), oxidative stress,  or methamphetamine-induced cortical neuronal injury (Jiang et al.,  2014; Ding et al., 2015; Xiong et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2019; Guo et al.,  2020). Inhibition of necroptosis is extremely important for reducing neuronal death (Wu et al., 2015; Cruz et al., 2018; Wang et al.,  2018a; 2018b; 2018c; 2018d). However, the regulatory mechanisms  of necroptosis have not yet been fully elucidated.

> In contrast, a number  of studies have reported that the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)  may regulate necroptosis via the formation of a necrosome (RIP1/  RIP3) in HT-29 cells and cortical neurons (Li et al., 2015; Jacobsen  and Silke, 2016; Wang et al., 2018a; 2018b; 2018c; 2018d; ).

> ). However, only the Ser/Thr  residue of Rps6k (ribosomal protein S6 kinase) showed phosphorylating activity in their study. Rps6k is widely expressed in different  types of neurons and is involved in cerebral hypoxia-ischemia injury  by phosphorylating its substrate proteins (Vazquez-Higuera et al.,  2011; Miyake et al., 2015). Also, Rps6k is likely involved in the process of phosphorylation of the key protein RIP3 in the necroptotic  pathway. Currently, the molecular pathways underlying I/R injury of  regulated necrosis in retinal neurons remain elusive.
