> Ischemic stroke with a mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) or T2-weighted images indicates onset  within 4.5 h, but the pathological substrates in the DWI-T2 mismatch and T2(+)  areas remain elusive. In this study, proteomics was used to explore (1) the  protein expression profiles in the T2(+), mismatch, and contralateral areas, and  (2) the protein with the highest expression in the T2(+) area in the brains of  male Sprague-Dawley rats within 4.5 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion  (MCAO). The expression of the candidate protein was further validated in (1) rat  brain subjected to MCAO, (2) rat primary cortical neuronal culture with  oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), and (3) infarcted human brain tissues. This  study showed that apoptosis was observed in the T2(+) and mismatch regions and  necroptosis in the T2(+) region of rat brains after MCAO. We identified capping  protein regulator and myosin 1 linker 3 (CARMIL3) as the candidate molecule in  the T2(+) and mismatch areas, exclusively in neurons, predominantly in the  cytoplasm, and most abundant in the mismatch area. The CARMIL3(+) neurons and  neurites in the mismatch and T2(+) areas were larger than those in the control  area, and associated with (1) increased expression of sulfonylurea receptor 1  (SUR1), indicating edema, (2) accumulation of p62, indicating impaired autophagy,  and (3) increase in 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), indicating oxidative  stress. The increased expression of CARMIL3 was validated in a cell model of  cortical neurons after OGD and in infarcted human brain tissues. In conclusion,  this study shows that the mismatch and T2(+) areas within 4.5 h after ischemia  are characterized by upregulated expression of CARMIL3 in neurons, particularly  the mismatch area, which is associated with neuronal edema, impaired autophagy,  and oxidative stress, indicating that CARMIL3 serves as a molecular signature of  brain ischemia.

> In ischemic stroke, the phenomenon with positive signals on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) but negative signals on fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is defined as DWI-FLAIR mismatch, which indicates ischemia within 4.5 h (Thomalla et al., 2011).

> Neurons are extremely sensitive to ischemia, and the expression patterns of several molecules are altered in ischemic neurons. Structural proteins such as microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) have reduced immunoreactivity within 12 and 24 h, respectively, after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (Buscemi et al., 2019).

> Free radicals contribute to the ischemia-induced cellular edema; 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is a hallmark of oxidative DNA damage that is increased in the periinfarct regions but not in the infarct core at 24 h following pMCAO (Nagayama et al., 2000).

> he neuronal densities did not change in the T2(+) and mismatch regions compared with those in the control region, but the NeuN intensity in some  neurons decreased in the T2(+) region (Figures 2A,B). We then investigated whether apoptosis and necroptosis were involved in these regions by examining the expression of active caspase 3 and phosphorylated receptor-interacting protein 3 (pRIP3), respectively. The densities of active caspase 3(+) cells indicating apoptosis in the mismatch and T2(+) areas were significantly higher than those in the control area (Figures 2C,D). The pRIP3(+) area proportion [the area of pRIP3(+) divided by the total analyzed area] was larger in the T2(+) region than in the control region (Figures 2E,F). 
  **The mismach earia lower with necroptosis, but sufficient level of apoptosis.**

> he Cellular Pathology in the Mismatch and T2(+) Regions  Given the lack of information on the pathological and molecular expression patterns in the mismatch regions after ischemic stroke, we first demonstrated that the cell and NeuN(+) neuronal densities did not change significantly in the T2(+)  and mismatch areas. NeuN is a specific neuronal marker expressed in most types of neurons in the central nervous system (Gusel’nikova and Korzhevskiy, 2015). Some neurons, especially the damaged ones, might lose NeuN immunoreactivity due to decreased synthesis or changed immunoreactivity of NeuN, which may underestimate neuron density (Unal-Cevik et al., 2004). We showed that some neurons had a faint NeuN staining in the T2(+) region, indicating the transition to the absence of NeuN immunoreactivity. In addition to brain ischemia, various brain pathologies such as irradiation injury, poison toxicity, and viral infection also reduce NeuN immunoreactivity in neurons (Collombet et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2010; Hahn et al., 2015). Altogether, this study provides evidence of changes in the pathology of ischemic neurons with a short ischemic duration.
