> An excessive activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) may trigger a form of neuronal death similar to that occurring in neurodegenerative disorders. To investigate this process, we exposed organotypic hippocampal slices to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N'-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG, 100μM for 5min), an alkylating agent widely used to activate PARP-1. MNNG induced a pattern of degeneration of the CA1 pyramidal cells morphologically similar to that observed after a brief period of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). MNNG exposure was also associated with a dramatic increase in PARP-activity and a robust decrease in NAD(+) and ATP content. These effects were prevented by PARP-1 but not PARP-2 inhibitors. In our experimental conditions, cell death was not mediated by AIF translocation (parthanatos) or caspase-dependent apoptotic processes. Furthermore, we found that PARP activation was followed by a significant deterioration of neuronal membrane properties. Using electrophysiological recordings we firstly investigated the suggested ability of ADP-ribose to open TRPM2 channels in MNNG-induced cells death, but the results we obtained showed that TRPM2 channels are not involved. We then studied the involvement of glutamate receptor-ion channel complex and we found that NBQX, a selective AMPA receptor antagonist, was able to effectively prevent CA1 neuronal loss while MK801, a NMDA antagonist, was not active. Moreover, we observed that MNNG treatment increased the ratio of GluA1/GluA2 AMPAR subunit expression, which was associated with an inward rectification of the IV relationship of AMPA sEPSCs in the CA1 but not in the CA3 subfield. Accordingly, 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine (NASPM), a selective blocker of Ca(2+)-permeable GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors, reduced MNNG-induced CA1 pyramidal cell death. In conclusion, our results show that activation of the nuclear enzyme PARP-1 may change the expression of membrane proteins and Ca(2+) permeability of AMPA channels, thus affecting the function and survival of CA1 pyramidal cells.

> Since the early eighties, however, Berger et al. reported that excessive activation of PARP-1 may cause cellular NAD+ and ATP depletion and a “metabolic catastrophe” or “PARP-induced suicide” which was considered an “evolutionary strategy” of multicellular organisms to prevent the survival of excessively damaged cells (Berger, 1985).

> Nuclear, cytosol and mitochondrial isolation  Nuclei, cytosol and mitochondria were isolated from organotypic hippocampal slices (12 or 16 slices for each sample) after 6 h of treatment with 100 μM MNNG (5 min). Organotypic slices were washed in PBS and homogenized using a glass/glass potter in 500 μl of isolation buffer (TRIS/MOPS 10 mM,EGTA/TRIS 1 mM, sucrose 200 mM pH 7.4). Extracts were first centrifuged at 600 g for 10 min to obtain the nuclear fraction and then were centrifuged at 7000 g for 10 min to obtain the mitochondrial pellet. Supernatants resulted in cytosolic fraction. Nuclear pellet was resuspended and washed in RIPA buffer containing 0.05% (v/v) of NP-40.

  **Gerace E et al. showed that PARP1 activity could lead to another form of cell death different from parthanatos in one key way: the AIF does not participate in it.**
