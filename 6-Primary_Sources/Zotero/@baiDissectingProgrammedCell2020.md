> Programmed cell death (PCD) is fundamentally an indispensable process in all cellular activities, including cell development, wound healing, and immune surveillance of tumors (Galluzzi, L. et al. Cell Death Differ. 2018, 25, 486-541). Malfunctioning of PCD has been shown to be closely related to human diseases such as acute pancreatitis, neurodegenerative diseases, and diverse types of cancers. To date, multiple PCD processes have been discovered and the corresponding regulatory pathways have been elucidated. For example, apoptosis and autophagy are two PCD mechanisms that have been well studied by sophisticated models and probe toolkits. However, limited genetic and chemical tools for other types of PCD hamper the elucidation of their molecular mechanisms. Our group has been studying PCD using both function-oriented synthesis and chemical biology strategies, including the development of diverse chemical probes based on novel PCD modulators. For instance, in the development of downstream programmed necrosis (or necroptosis) inhibitor necrosulfonamide, we used a chemical probe to unveil a functional protein that was not previously implicated in necroptosis, mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). In addition, high throughput screening and medicinal chemistry enabled the discovery of bioymifi, a small molecule agonist which selectively causes oligomerization of the death receptor 5 (DR5), to induce extrinsic apoptosis. Furthermore, we developed a biomimetic synthetic strategy based on diverse Diels-Alder reactions in the total syntheses of ainsliadimers A and B, ainsliatrimers A and B, and gonchnatiolides A-C, which are natural product inhibitors or activators for PCD. Using synthetic ainsliadimer A probe, we elucidated that ainsliadimer A inhibits the NF-κB pathway by covalently binding to Cys46 of IKKβ and triggers apoptosis of cancer cells. We have also revealed that IKKβ is allosterically inhibited by ainsliadimer A. In addition to total synthesis, we have developed a bioorthogonal click hetero-Diels-Alder cycloaddition of vinyl thioether and o-quinolinone quinone methide (TQ-ligation) to facilitate small molecule target identification. The combination of total synthesis and TQ-ligation enables subcellular imaging and identification of the cellular target of ainsliatrimer A to be PPARγ. In addition, TQ-ligation has been applied in the discovery of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) as one of the functional target proteins for kongensin A. We also confirmed that kongensin A covalently attaches to Cys420 within HSP90 and demonstrated that kongensin A blocks the interaction between HSP90 and CDC37 and subsequently inhibits necroptosis. Our development of these diverse PCD modulators provides not only effective chemical tools for fundamental biomedical research, but also the foundation for drug discovery targeting important human diseases such as cancers and inflammation caused by malfunction of PCD.

High-throughput screening (HTS) has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of cell-death mechanisms. The use of small-molecule libraries in combination with high-content imaging has enabled the discovery of key modulators such as necrosulfonamide (an MLKL inhibitor that blocks necroptosis) and biomifilins (Biomifi), which act as inducers of extrinsic apoptosis. Studies like those by Bai et al. exemplify how systematic chemical screening can dissect complex death pathways at the molecular level, revealing specific regulatory nodes and providing valuable pharmacological tools for distinguishing between apoptosis, necroptosis, and other programmed cell-death processes.
