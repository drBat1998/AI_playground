> PANoptosis is a novelly defined mode of programmed cell death that involves the activation of multiple cellular death pathways, including pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, triggering robust inflammatory reactions. Autophagy is a crucial cellular process that maintains cellular homeostasis and protects cells from various stresses. PANoptosis and autophagy, both vital players in the intricate pathological progression of ischemic stroke (IS), a brain ailment governed by intricate cell death cascades, have garnered attention in recent years for their potential interplay. While mounting evidence hints at a crosstalk between these two processes in IS, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Therefore, this review delves into and dissects the intricate mechanisms that underpin the intersection of PANoptosis and autophagy in this devastating condition. In conclusion, the crosstalk between PANoptosis and autophagy in IS presents a promising target for the development of novel stroke therapies. Understanding the interplay between these two pathways offers a much-needed insight into the underlying mechanisms of IS and opens the possibility for new therapeutic strategies.

> MLKL can also indirectly activate the NLRP3 inflammasome by promoting the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from damaged mitochondria. This mtDNA release triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the subsequent induction of pyroptosis (Han et al., 2019).

> The PANoptosome is composed of various receptors, including ZBP1 and inflammasome components, along with adapters like ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain), as well as catalytic effectors such as caspase-1, RIP3, RIP1, and caspase-8

> n the context of PANoptosis, inflammasomes act as key integrators, enabling communication between pyroptosis and other cell death pathways. The activation of caspase-1, along with various effectors, orchestrates the simultaneous activation of multiple death mechanisms, resulting in PANoptosis.

> . This suggests that in the absence of NLRP3 or pyroptosis, cell death becomes dependent on caspase-8 and RIP3 (Zheng et al., 2020). 
  **Although the knockdown of NLRP3 or GSDMD reduces early cell death, the overall incidence of inflammatory cell death rises over time, driven by caspase-8 and RIP3.**

> The interplay between autophagy and necroptosis in IS. After IS, TNF-α elevation triggers complex I/II formation, transforming into necrosome under caspase-8 inhibition. This prompts RIP1 activation, RIP3 and MLKL phosphorylation, accelerating necroptosis, which modulates autophagy. RIPK1 and RIPK3 stimulate AMPK, fostering autophagy via the AMPK/TSC/ mTORC1 pathway. RIPK3 also phosphorylates ULK1 for alternate autophagy. Conversely, RIPK1 hinders autophagy by activating NF-κB and disrupting autophagosome-lysosome fusion via SNARE complex interference. MLKL inhibits autophagy by activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and damaging autophagosomal membranes, disrupting autophagic flux.

> Recent studies have illuminated the pivotal role that RIPK1 and RIPK3 plays in regulating cellular processes, particularly in the context of amino acid availability, autophagy, and programmed cell death (Tian et al., 2022; Wu X. et al., 2020). RIPK1 and RIPK3 emerge as pivotal players, not merely initiating necroptosis but also intricately intertwining with autophagy signaling pathways to preserve cellular homeostasis. Specifically, they regulate the availability of asparagine, a crucial amino acid that directly influences AMPK (AMP-Activated Protein Kinase) activation—a master switch for autophagy. By modulating asparagine levels, RIPK1 and RIPK3 subtly impact AMPK’s activity, thereby indirectly governing the initiation and progression of autophagy. Autophagy, being a fundamental cellular process, ensures the degradation and recycling of damaged or redundant cellular constituents, thereby maintaining cellular integrity and survival.
