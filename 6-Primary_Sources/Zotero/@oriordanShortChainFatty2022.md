# Abstract 
The role of the intestinal microbiota as a regulator of gut-brain axis signalling has risen to prominence in recent years. Understanding the relationship between the gut microbiota, the metabolites it produces, and the brain will be critical for the subsequent development of new therapeutic approaches, including the identification of novel psychobiotics. A key focus in this regard have been the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fibre, which include butyrate, acetate, and propionate. Ongoing research is focused on the entry of SCFAs into systemic circulation from the gut lumen, their migration to cerebral circulation and across the blood brain barrier, and their potential to exert acute and chronic effects on brain structure and function. This review aims to discuss our current mechanistic understanding of the direct and indirect influence that SCFAs have on brain function, behaviour and physiology, which will inform future microbiota-targeted interventions for brain disorders.

> SCFA concentrations in the blood have been reported highest in the portal circulation, lower in the hepatic circulation and lowest in the peripheral circulation, where mean concentrations were 70 μmol/l for acetate, 5 μmol/l for propionate, and 4 μmol/l for butyrate (Cummings et al., 1987).

> Here it was noted that concentrations of acetate and butyrate peaked in the caecum, while propionate peaked in the ascending colon. SCFA concentrations reduce as they pass through the large intestine, but each undergo a small increase upon reaching the rectum (Cummings et al., 1987). Levels of SCFAs in human faeces have been reported as approximately 60 g/kg (1 mol/kg) for acetate, 10–20 g/kg (136–274 mmol/kg) for propionate, and 3.5–32.6 g/kg (40–374 mmol/kg) for butyrate (McOrist et al., 2011; Macfarlane and Macfarlane, 2003); this is commonly cited as a 60:20:20 ratio (den Besten et al., 2013).

> While some foods contain SFCAs, the primary source is from colonic microbial fermentation of specific host-indigestible and non-absorbable dietary fibres (Macfarlane and Macfarlane, 2003; Baxter et al., 2019); examples include inulin, wheat bran, cellulose, and resistant starches. This is supported by the fact that germ-free animals (lacking a gut-microbiota and hence gut microbiota-derived SCFAs) and antibiotic treated mice (that have a strongly ablated gut-microbiota) have markedly lower SCFA levels (Backhed et al., 2007; Hoverstad and Midtvedt, 1986; Palleja et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2016). Other sources of endogenous SCFAs include the breakdown of proteins by the microbiota (Yao et al., 2016), host metabolism of long-chain fatty acids and pyruvate into acetate (Knowles et al., 1974), as well as the consumption of alcohol (Sarkola et al., 2002). Minor amounts of SCFAs can also be attained by the consumption of fermented foods (Gill et al., 2018).

> Most SCFA anions are co-absorbed with cations such as Na+ or K+ (for example: reviewed in (Stumpff, 2018)). Facilitated SCFA diffusion through epithelia uses transporters such as the sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter (SMCT1) (Miyauchi et al., 2004; Cuff and Shirazi-Beechey, 2002), and the pH dependent hydrogen-coupled monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and 4 (Keduka et al., 2013; Tamai et al., 1995; Thangaraju et al, 2008). Other transporters for SCFAs exist but are thought to be quantitatively less important (for example: reviewed in (Dalile et al., 2019)).

[[SCFAs distribution]]
Short-chain fatty acids (SFCAs) are a group of small fatty acids that have a significant impact on the brain.  While some SFCAs come from food, the primary source is from microbial fermentation. This notion supports a remarkable decrease in their level in germ-free animals or after antibiotic treatment. Although SCFAs can be absorbed directly by diffusion, major SCFAs are absorbed by facilitated diffusion as salts by sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter (SMCT1) and pH-dependent hydrogen-coupled monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and 4. After that their moved through the blood to the liver, where they are partially metabolized, so only a portion of them may further reach the brain. Mean concentrations in the bloodwere 70 μmol/l for acetate, 5 μmol/l for propionate, and 4 μmol/l for butyrate. In addition, they have another obstacle before influencing the brain, the blood-brain barrier, which they can pass through. The Human Metabolome Database reports cerebrospinal fluid SCFA concentrations as 0–171 μM for acetate, 0–5 μM for propionate, and 0–2.8 μM for butyrate. As a consequence, they was ditected in the human brain as 17.0 pmol/mg of tissue for butyrate and 18.8 pmol/mg of tissue for propionate.
