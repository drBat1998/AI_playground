> BACKGROUND: Steatosis in donor livers poses a major risk of organ dysfunction due to their susceptibility to ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury during transplant.  Necroptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death, is orchestrated by  receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), receptor-interacting protein  kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed-lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL), has  been implicated in I/R injury. Here we investigated the mechanisms of cell death  pathways in an in vitro model of hepato-steatotic ischaemia. METHODS: Free fatty  acid (FFA) treated alpha mouse liver 12 (AML-12) cells were incubated in  oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD) conditions as seen during ischaemia. RESULTS: We  found that OGD triggered upregulation of insoluble fraction of RIPK3 and MLKL in  FFA + OGD cells compared to FFA control cells. We report that intervention with  small interfering (si) MLKL and siRIPK3 significantly attenuated cell death in  FFA + OGD cells. Absence of activated CASPASE8 and cleaved-CASPASE3, no change in  the expression of CASPASE1 and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2) in  FFA + OGD treated cells compared to FFA control cells indicated that apoptosis,  pyroptosis and ferroptosis, respectively, are unlikely to be active in this  model. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that RIPK3-MLKL dependent necroptosis  contributed to cell death in our in vitro model. Both MLKL and RIPK3 are  promising therapeutic targets to inhibit necroptosis during ischaemic injury in  fatty liver.
