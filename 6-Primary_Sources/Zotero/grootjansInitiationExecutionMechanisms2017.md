> Necroptosis is a form of regulated cell death, which is induced by ligand binding to TNF family death domain receptors, pattern recognizing receptors and virus sensors. The common feature of these receptor systems is the implication of proteins, which contain a receptor interaction protein kinase (RIPK) homology interaction motif (RHIM) mediating recruitment and activation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), which ultimately activates the necroptosis executioner mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). In case of the TNF family members, the initiator is the survival- and cell death-regulating RIPK1 kinase, in the case of Toll-like receptor 3/4 (TLR3/4), a RHIM-containing adaptor, called TRIF, while in the case of Z-DNA-binding protein ZBP1/DAI, the cytosolic viral sensor itself contains a RHIM domain. In this review, we discuss the different protein complexes that serve as nucleation platforms for necroptosis and the mechanism of execution of necroptosis. Transgenic models (knockout, kinase-dead knock-in) and pharmacologic inhibition indicate that RIPK1, RIPK3 or MLKL are implicated in many inflammatory, degenerative and infectious diseases. However, the conclusion of necroptosis being solely involved in the etiology of diseases is blurred by the pleiotropic roles of RIPK1 and RIPK3 in other cellular processes such as apoptosis and inflammasome activation.

> However, since neither the kinase-dead RIPK1 knock-in mice,33 nor the RIPK334 or MLKL35 knockout mice do have a spontaneous phenotype under non-challenged conditions, this strongly suggests that the core necroptotic pathway is mainly implicated in pathophysiological conditions of infection and disease. 
  **Few articles suggest posible implementation of necroptosis in physiological context. Moreover, genetically disraption of RIPK3 and MLKL do not show any phenotypical problems, there function are mainly pathophysiological.**

> In cells, necroptosis can be initiated by a variety of triggers, including TNF, Fas, TNFrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon (IFN), lippopolysaccharide, dsRNA, DNA damage, endoplasmatic reticulum stress, viral infection and anti-cancer drugs.36–44

> It was shown that administration of Nec-1 could reduce cell death and/or mortality in several disease models, including brain infarct,15 cardiac infarct,46,47 TNF-induced systemic inflammatory respiratory syndrome (SIRS),48 ConAor acetaminophen-induced hepatitis,39,49 and ischemiareperfusion injury (IRI) in kidneys.50

> An interesting systematic study comparing RIPK1 kinase-dead knock-in mice, RIPK3 knockout and MLKL knockout in different models of inflammation and tissue injury60 revealed that loss of RIPK3 had no effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis, dextran sodium sulfateinduced colitis, cerulein-induced pancreatitis, hypoxia-induced cerebral edema or the major cerebral artery occlusion stroke model.60 This suggests that previous studies with Nec-1, which intended to reveal a role for necroptosis probably revealed the multiple targeting effects of Nec-1 such as apoptosis and IDO.

> Furthermore, RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL may have unknown functions in the nucleus as they translocate to the nucleus early during necroptosis.75

> More recently, calcium-dependent protein kinase II delta (CAMK2D) was identified as another potential substrate of RIPK3.104 RIPK3 phosphorylates CAMK2D at Thr387, which results in the activation of CAMK2D.104 Importantly, CAMK2D apparently executes necrotic cell death independently of MLKL.104
