> Introduction: Acridine orange (AO) was first extracted from coal tar in the late nineteenth century and was used as a fluorescent dye. In this paper, we review emergent research about novel applications of AO for fluorescence surgery and cancer therapy., Materials and methods: We performed a systematic search in the MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus database using combinations of the term “acridine orange” with the following: “surgical oncology,” “neuropathology,” “microsurgery,” “intraoperative fluorescence,” “confocal microscopy,” “pathology,” “endomicroscopy,” “guidance,” “fluorescence guidance,” “oncology,” “surgery,” “neurooncology,” and “photodynamic therapy.” Peer-reviewed articles published in English were included in this review. We have also scanned references for relevant articles., Results: We have reviewed studies on the various application of AO in microscopy, endomicroscopy, intraoperative fluorescence guidance, photodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy, radiodynamic therapy., Conclusion: Although the number of studies on the clinical use of AO is limited, pilot studies have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of its application as an intraoperative fluorescent dye and as a novel photo- and radio-sensitizator. Further clinical studies are necessary to more definitively assess the clinical benefit AO-based fluorescence guidance, therapy for sarcomas, and to establish feasibility of this new approach for the treatment of other tumor types.

> In live cells, AO diffuses through the cytoplasmic membrane and is retained in the cellular compartments with low pH, resulting in a bright orange fluorescence of lysosomes when excited with a blue light. AO also intercalates with the cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA molecules and results in a diffuse green fluorescence within all cells (7, 8). AO does not intercalate with DNA of intact living cells (9) and does not accumulate in other non-acidic organelles, such as the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, or Golgi apparatus (7).

> In both fixed permeabilized cells and cells undergoing apoptosis, pH compartmentalization is lost. Therefore, AO leaks from acidic lysosomes and diffusely binds to RNA and DNA molecules, resulting in yellow-orange fluorescence in the whole cell (6).

> Based on the unique spectral distinctions and differential staining of RNA and DNA molecules, AO can be used to distinguish stages of apoptosis and necroptosis (10). During apoptosis, cells stained with AO demonstrate nuclear shrinkage, cellular fragmentation, and loss of nuclear demarcation, appearing therefore as red cells. Eventually the cellular RNA and red AO emission is lost while fragmented green nucleus remains. In contrast, during necrosis or necroptosis, the orange lysosomal signal is lost due to their disruption and to loss of cellular RNA, while the green signal from smooth and shrunken nuclei remains (11).

> domicroscopy imaging (19). In dogs, IV administration of AO at 0.1 mg/kg showed no clinical signs of toxicity and no abnormalities were seen in the blood within 30 days (20). Serum AO levels decreased rapidly within 30 min and were below the detection limit (5 ng/ml) 2 h after intravenous administration (20). In a case report of AObased PDT in a cat with cutaneous malignant melanoma, no side effects were reported, where AO was administered locally to the surgical site at a dose of 1 μg/ml (21).
