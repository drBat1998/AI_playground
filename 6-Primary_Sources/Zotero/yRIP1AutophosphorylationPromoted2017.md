> Necroptosis is a type of programmed cell death with great significance in many pathological processes. Tumour necrosis factor-α(TNF), a proinflammatory cytokine, is a prototypic trigger of necroptosis. It is known that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote necroptosis, and that kinase …

> Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have long been considered as a driving force for necroptosis and also participate in apoptosis19,20. For example, it has been demonstrated that TNF can induce mitochondrial ROS and ROS enhance necrosome  formation21,22. Either elimination of ROS by scavengers such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), or inhibition of the electron transport chain by inhibitors such as amytal (also known as  amobarbital) can inhibit TNF-induced necroptosis19,23–27. In addition, the importance of ROS in inducing necroptosis has also been verified in vivo in a model of tuberculosis-infected  zebrafish28. However, BHA has no effect on TNF plus zVAD and Smac mimetics-induced necroptosis in HT-29 cells, suggesting that ROS are not involved in the necroptosis of  HT-29 cells7. And a recent study showed that deletion of mitochondria by mitophagy does not compromise necroptosis in  SVEC or 3T3-SA cells29.

> These data indicated that the targeting site of mitochondrial ROS should be at or downstream of RIP1 oligomerization and upstream of RIP3 in the necroptotic pathway.

> Thus, ROS’s function in necroptosis is very likely to be related to RIP1 kinase activity.

> Thus, how S161 phosphorylation of RIP1 affects the recruitment of RIP3 to necrosome might not be as simple as the change of RIP1’s affinities with necrosome-associated proteins.

> Published data have suggested that the involvement of ROS in  necroptosis is cell type-dependent7,23,25,29–31. Our data support this conclusion. It was known that TNF-induced ROS production  is RIP3 dependent8, and ROS function in a positive feedback loop  to enhance necrosome formation22. We discovered in this study that ROS promote RIP1 autophosphorylation on S161 and cysteine 257, 268 and 586 in RIP1 are required for ROS to regulate RIP1. These three cysteines are required for the formation of disulfide bond-linked high molecular weight aggregate of RIP1 to enhance RIP1 S161 autophosphorylation, which then facilitates necrosome formation.
