> Currently, there is no efficient therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI). Anoxemia after SCI is a key problem, which leads to tissue destruction, while hypoxia  after SCI induces cell injury along with inflammation. Mixed-lineage kinase  domain-like protein (MLKL) is a critical signal molecule of necroptosis, and  mitochondrial dysfunction is regarded as one of the most pivotal events after  SCI. Based on the important role of MLKL in cell damage and potential role of  mitochondrial dysfunction, our study focuses on the regulation of MLKL by  Necrosulfonamide (NSA) in mitochondrial dysfunction of oxygen-glucose deprivation  (OGD)-induced cell damage and SCI-mice, which specifically blocks the MLKL. Our  results showed that NSA protected against a decrease in the mitochondrial  membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase  levels and an increase in reactive oxygen species and malonyldialdehyde levels.  NSA also improved the locomotor function in SCI-mice and OGD-induced spinal  neuron injury through inhibition of MLKL activation independently of  receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3) phosphorylation. Besides the  protective effects, NSA exhibited a therapeutic window. The optimal treatment  time was within 12 h after the injury in the SCI-mice model. In conclusion, our  data suggest a close association between the NSA level inhibiting p-MLKL  independently of RIP3 phosphorylation and induction of neurological impairment by  improving antioxidative capacity after SCI. NSA ameliorates neurological  impairment in SCI through inhibiting MLKL-dependent necroptosis. It also provides  a theoretical basis for further research and application of NSA in the treatment  of SCI.

  **Spinal cord injury caused by primary damage, direct damage of the tissue, and secondary damage, which involve vascular, cellular, and biochemical events.**

  **Delayed neuronal death occures by many causes such as free radicals, glutamate, tumour necrosis factor, ischemia, and hypoxia.**

  **The most valuable information is that OGD/R model are also used in case of spinal cord injury.**

> Gutierrez et al. verified that MLKL activation triggered potassium efflux and assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which processes and activates IL-1b during necroptosis, and MLKL activation also caused cell membrane disruption to allow the efficient release of IL-1b (Gutierrez et al., 2017). 
  **Does pyroptosis and necroptosis are interacte between each other.**
