> Diquat (DQ) poisoning is a severe medical condition associated with life-threatening implications and multiorgan dysfunction. Despite its clinical significance, the precise underlying mechanism remains inadequately understood. This study elucidates that DQ induces instability in the mitochondrial genome of endothelial cells, resulting in the accumulation of Z-form DNA. This process activates Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), which then interacts with receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), ultimately leading to RIPK3-dependent necroptotic and ferroptotic signaling cascades. Specific deletion of either Zbp1 or Ripk3 in endothelial cells simultaneously inhibits both necroptosis and ferroptosis. This dual inhibition significantly reduces organ damage and lowers mortality rate. Notably, our investigation reveals that RIPK3 has a dual role. It not only phosphorylates MLKL to induce necroptosis but also phosphorylates FSP1 to inhibit its enzymatic activity, promoting ferroptosis. The study further shows that deletion of mixed lineage kinase domain-like (Mlkl) and the augmentation of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)-dependent non-canonical vitamin K cycling can provide partial protection against DQ-induced organ damage. Combining Mlkl deletion with vitamin K treatment demonstrates a heightened efficacy in ameliorating multiorgan damage and lethality induced by DQ. Taken together, this study identifies ZBP1 as a crucial sensor for DQ-induced mitochondrial Z-form DNA, initiating RIPK3-dependent necroptosis and ferroptosis. These findings suggest that targeting the ZBP1/RIPK3-dependent necroptotic and ferroptotic pathways could be a promising approach for drug interventions aimed at mitigating the adverse consequences of DQ poisoning.

> Strikingly, it is noteworthy that ROS exerts influence over mtDNA stability because of mtDNA lacking free DNA ends experiences reduced torsional strain during replication and transcription, which potentially promotes a transition from B- to Z-DNA structures [7, 10]. This transition is driven by diminished activities of mitochondrial DNA topoisomerases, particularly DNA topoisomerase I mitochondrial (TOP1MT) and DNA topoisomerase III alpha (TOP3A) [11]. Recent research highlights the pivotal role of Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) as a receptor for nuclear Z-DNA [12], doublestranded Z-RNA [13–15], and Z- mtDNA [16, 17].

> DQ can initiate both necroptotic and ferroptotic pathways, contingent upon the presence of mitochondrial ROS and the formation of Z-mtDNA. We observed that ZBP1 is activated in response to Z-mtDNA, subsequently instigating RIPK3-dependent necroptotic and ferroptotic signaling cascades. Notably, RIPK3 assumes a dual role, phosphorylating MLKL to induce necroptosis and phosphorylating FSP1 to inhibit its enzymatic activity to trigger ferroptosis.
