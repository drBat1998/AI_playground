> Steatotic donor livers are becoming more and more common in liver transplantation. However, the current use of steatotic grafts is less acceptable than normal grafts due to their higher susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. To investigate the mechanism underlying the susceptibility of steatotic liver to I/R injury, we detected cell death markers and inflammation in clinical donor livers and animal models. We found that caspase-8-mediated hepatic apoptosis is activated in steatotic liver I/R injury. However, ablation of caspase-8 only slightly mitigated steatotic liver I/R injury without affecting inflammation. We further demonstrated that RIPK1 kinase induces both caspase-8-mediated apoptosis and cell death-independent inflammation. Inhibition of RIPK1 kinase significantly protects against steatotic liver I/R injury by alleviating both hepatic apoptosis and inflammation. Additionally, we found that RIPK1 activation is induced by Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) but not the canonical TNF-α pathway during steatotic liver I/R injury. Deletion of ZBP1 substantially decreases the steatotic liver I/R injury. Mechanistically, ZBP1 is amplified by palmitic acid-activated JNK pathway in steatotic livers. Upon I/R injury, excessive reactive oxygen species trigger ZBP1 activation by inducing its aggregation independent of the Z-nucleic acids sensing action in steatotic livers, leading to the kinase activation of RIPK1 and the subsequent aggravation of liver injury. Thus, ZBP1-mediated RIPK1-driven apoptosis and inflammation exacerbate steatotic liver I/R injury, which could be targeted to protect steatotic donor livers during transplantation.

> RIPK1 inhibition had no effect on steatosis of steatotic livers (Supplemental Figure 5D) — consistent with previous studies (15) — but significantly decreased hepatic apoptosis (Figure 2H and Supplemental Figure 5E) and inflammation (Figure 2I and Supplemental Figure 5F) in both normal and steatotic livers after I/R.

> Consequently, Tnf deficiency did not affect liver injury or hepatic apoptosis and inflammation in steatotic liver I/R (Supplemental Figure 6, A–G).

> Casp8 knockout did not cause notable lesions or impact steatosis of steatotic liver (Supplemental Figure 3, A and B), which is consistent with the absence of RIPK3 in hepatocytes (16).

> Similarly, Casp8 knockdown in rat livers slightly reduced steatotic liver injury (Supplemental Figure 4, D–F) and had no effect on inflammation of recipients of steatotic donor livers after OLT (Supplemental Figure 4, G and H).

> Importantly, we observed increased RIPK1 activation in hepatocytes isolated from human steatotic donor livers after reperfusion and mouse steatotic livers after I/R when compared with those from respective normal control livers

> In all of the above experiments, inhibition of RIPK1 with Nec-1s prevented hepatic apoptosis, inflammation, and liver damage in I/R-challenged ZBP1-overexpressing livers (Figure 4, C–H and Supplemental Figure 10, I–L), suggesting that RIPK1 is indispensable for ZBP1-mediated liver injury in I/R.

> Because ROS also acts as an important driving factor contributing to I/R injury (57, 58), we hypothesized that ROS may trigger ZBP1 aggregation and activation in liver I/R. Consistent with this hypothesis, in HEK293T cells expressing human ZBP1 and GFP fusion protein (hZBP1-GFP), treatment with H2O2 was sufficient to induce the aggregation of ZBP1 (Figure 7C)

> Nevertheless, it was reported that necroptosis also plays a significant role in liver I/R injury (13), which was challenged by recent studies showing that RIPK3 is epigenetically silenced in mouse and human hepatocytes and rendered them unable to undergo necroptosis (14–16).

> Next, we assessed the interaction of ZBP1 and RIPK1 during steatotic liver I/R. RIPK1 was coimmunoprecipitated with ZBP1 in Zbp1+/+ steatotic hepatocytes after I/R but not in the sham condition, which was abolished in Zbp1–/– steatotic hepatocytes (

> Our study reveals that ROS generated during liver I/R facilitates ZBP1 aggregation and activation, presumably due to ROS-mediated disulfide bond formation, which has been observed in a previous study (65). This finding may have a significant impact on the understanding of activation mechanism of ZBP1, which might be implicated in other human diseases since ROS is frequently activated in many pathologic conditions.
