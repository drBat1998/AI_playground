> AIM: C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) is a transcription factor that is activated at multiple levels during ER stress and plays an important role in ER stress-induced apoptosis. In this study we identified a novel CHOP activator, and further investigated its potential to be a therapeutic agent for human lung cancer.
METHODS: HEK293-CHOP-luc reporter cells were used in high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify CHOP activators. The cytotoxicity against cancer cells in vitro was measured with MTT assay. The anticancer effects were further examined in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer xenograft mice. The mechanisms underlying CHOP activation were analyzed using luciferase assays, and the anticancer mechanisms were elucidated in A549 cells.
RESULTS: From chemical libraries of 50 000 compounds, LGH00168 was identified as a CHOP activator, which showed cytotoxic activities against a panel of 9 cancer cell lines with an average IC50 value of 3.26 μmol/L. Moreover, administration of LGH00168 significantly suppressed tumor growth in A549 xenograft bearing mice. LGH00168 activated CHOP promoter via AARE1 and AP1 elements, increased DR5 expression, decreased Bcl-2 expression, and inhibited the NF-κB pathway. Treatment of A549 cells with LGH00168 (10 μmol/L) did not induce apoptosis, but lead to RIP1-dependent necroptosis, accompanied by cell swelling, plasma membrane rupture, lysosomal membrane permeabilization, MMP collapse and caspase 8 inhibition. Furthermore, LGH00168 (10 and 20 μmol/L) dose-dependently induced mito-ROS production in A549 cells, which was reversed by the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, 10 mmol/L). Moreover, NAC significantly diminished LGH00168-induced CHOP activation, NF-κB inhibition and necroptosis in A549 cells.
CONCLUSION: LGH00168 is a CHOP activator that inhibits A549 cell growth in vitro and lung tumor growth in vivo.

> Propidium iodide/Hoechst 33342 (PI/HO) double staining  Plasma membrane permeability (PMP) and nuclear morphology were evaluated using PI/HO double staining as described previously[36] with modifications as follows: A549 cells were cultured on glass coverslips and incubated with LGH00168 for 4 h. Next, the cells were stained with 40 mg/L of PI and 20 mg/L of Hoechst 33342 in 1× PBS for 15 min in the dark. After washing twice with 1× PBS, the slides were mounted, sealed and observed under an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured with an Olympus DP72 digital camera (Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop CS4 software (San Jose, CA, USA).

> Determination of lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) using acridine orange/Hoechst33342 (AO/HO) staining  The metachromatic fluorophore AO is retained in its charged  form (AOH+) by proton trapping within the acidic vacuolar compartment. When normal cells are excited by blue light, highly concentrated lysosomal AO emits an intense red granular fluorescence, and the nuclei and cytosol show weak diffuse green fluorescence. LMP results in reduced red fluorescence and bright green cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence. LMP induction by LGH00168 was observed using AO/HO double staining[37]. Cells were treated with LGH00168 for 4 h and then were incubated with 5 mg/L of AO for 10 min in the dark. Images were captured with an Olympus DP72 digital camera (Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed in Adobe Photoshop CS4 software (San Jose, CA, USA).

> Measurement of the mitochondrial ROS (mito-ROS)  The mito-ROS level was examined by a MitoSOX Red mitochondrial superoxide indicator (Cat #M36008, Life technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were treated with LGH00168 for 1 h, collected by trypsin treatment, washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS, and then incubated with 5 μmol/L of MitoSOX for 20 min in the dark. The mito-ROS level was measured using a BD FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer and analyzed with FCS Express V3 software (De Novo Software, Glendale, CA, USA).

> Measurement of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) The Δψm level was measured using a JC-1 dye (Cat #T-3168, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to a previous report with modifications[38]. Briefly, cells were seeded into black-bottomed 96-well optical plates (Greiner Bio-One, Dusseldorf, Germany). After 24 h, LGH00168 was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. JC-1 at a final concentration of 10 mg/L was then added. The plates were incubated for another 20 min at 37 °C, and each well was washed three times with a Krebs-Ringer phosphate HEPES buffer. Fluorescence was measured in a Flexstation II plate reader (Molecular Device, Union City, CA, USA) first at excitation and emission wavelengths of (Ex/Em) 530 nm/580 nm (“red”) and then at Ex/Em 485 nm/530 nm (“green”). The ratio of red to green reflects Δψm. The results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 5.02 (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA)
