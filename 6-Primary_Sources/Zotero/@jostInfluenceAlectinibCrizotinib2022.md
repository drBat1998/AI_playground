> (1) Background: Just little is known about the interaction of ALK/ROS1-targeting kinase inhibitors with ionizing radiation (IR), particularly regarding side effects. We investigated the toxicity in two different lung cell lines both ALK/ROS1 wildtype (healthy and tumor origin) as representatives for normal lung tissue; (2) Methods: Human lung cell line BEAS-2B and malignant A549 lung cancer cells (ALK/ROS1 wt) were treated with alectinib or crizotinib, 2 Gy irradiation or a combination of KI and IR. Cell toxicity was analyzed by cell death (Annexin, 7AAD), colony forming, migration assay and live-cell imaging (TMRM, DRAQ7, Caspase3/7). Cell cycle (Hoechst) were analyzed by flow cytometry; (3) Results: Crizotinib led to higher cell death rates than alectinib, when cells were treated with 10 µM KI. Alectinib induced a more intense growth inhibition of colonies. Both inhibitors showed additive effects in combination with irradiation. Combination treatment (IR + KI) does not lead to synergistic effect on neither cell death nor colony forming; (4) Conclusions: The influence of simultaneous KI and IR was studied in non-mutated ALK/ROS1 cell lines. Both KIs seems to be well tolerated in combination with thoracic radiotherapy and lacked synergistic reinforcement in cellular toxicity. This supports the feasibility of ALK/ROS1 inhibition in combination with thoracic irradiation in future clinical trials.

> Analysis of mitochondrial activity, apoptosis and necrosis via live-cell imaging  Cells were seeded into T25 flasks. The calculated number of required cells (800,000 cells/mL) correlated with approximately 80 % coverage of the flask’s surface. After reaching the adequate cell number, the medium was reduced to 10 mL and the cells were incubated for 45 min with 25 nM Tetramethylrhodamine (TMRM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37°C and 5 % CO2. Subsequently, the medium was changed to FluoroBriteTM DMEM (Life Technologies Europe BV, Bleiswijk, Netherlands) and the fluorescent stains DRAQ7 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and CellEvent Caspase 3/7 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were added with the concentration of 3 μM and 10 μM. Furthermore, 10 mM of Good’s Buffer HEPES (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) was added. The mixture of cell and stain was parted. After adding 1 μM tyrosinkinase inhibitor (Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA) to one part, the mixture was divided onto two Rhombic Chamber microfluidic chips (microfluidic ChipShop, Jena, Germany) which were then  inserted under the microscope. After 3 h one of the chips was irradiated with 2 Gy by an ISOVOLT Titan X-ray generator (GE, Ahrensburg, Germany). A Leica DM6000B (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) recorded the images every 20 or 45 min for 3 days with differing wavelengths per each staining. For live cell imaging, the microscope was transformed into an incubating system. Four different positions were attributed to every condition 30–50 individual cells were analyzed within one position. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times. The imaging analyses was performed with Biomas Software (MSAB, Erlangen, Germany), where the background noise was then reduced, thus allowing the fluorescent color to intensify. The intensities of the different stains were transferred to spreadsheets (Excel, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and GraphPad Prism9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was then used for data evaluation. Data were normalized to foldchange at t0 = 1.
