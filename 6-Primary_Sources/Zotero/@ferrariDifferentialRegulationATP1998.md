> Apoptosis is induced by different stimuli, among them triggering of the death receptor CD95, staurosporine, and chemotherapeutic drugs. In all cases, apoptosis is mediated by caspases, although it is unclear how these diverse apoptotic stimuli cause protease activation. Two regulatory pathways have been recently identified, but it remains unknown whether they are functionally independent or linked to each other. One is mediated by recruitment of the proximal regulator caspase-8 to the death receptor complex. The other pathway is controlled by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the subsequent ATP-dependent activation of the death regulator apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1). Here, we report that both pathways can be dissected by depletion of intracellular ATP. Prevention of ATP production completely inhibited caspase activation and apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic drugs and staurosporine. Interestingly, caspase-8, whose function appeared to be restricted to death receptors, was also activated by these drugs under normal conditions, but not after ATP depletion. In contrast, inhibition of ATP production did not affect caspase activation after triggering of CD95. These results suggest that chemotherapeutic drug–induced caspase activation is entirely controlled by a receptor-independent mitochondrial pathway, whereas CD95-induced apoptosis can be regulated by a separate pathway not requiring Apaf-1 function.

> It has been suggested that the cellular energy charge acts as control point of cell death by either necrosis or apoptosis, and that ATP is necessary for the execution of the apoptotic program (25, 26, 30). In conjunction with cytochrome c, ATP is required for the function of Apaf-1, which initiates caspase activation in the mitochondria-controlled pathway (12, 13, 15).

> Under these conditions, ATP levels declined rapidly within 60 min. Treatment of Jurkat cells with anti-CD95 induced a marked cleavage of caspase-8 within 1 h that was not affected upon depletion of ATP by oligomycin (Fig. 2 A).

> n contrast to the CD95 pathway, ATP depletion strongly inhibited caspase-8 and -3 activation as well as PARP cleavage in response to the receptor-independent apoptotic stimuli.

> Therefore, the differential requirement of ATP for caspase activation by either CD95 or chemotherapeutic drugs indicates distinct regulatory pathways for the two types of apoptosis 

Conclusion:
[[ATP depletion inhibits CASP8 activation]]
ATP influence apoptosis pathway differently, intrinsic pathway is more vulnerable to ATP depletion than extrinsic. This data suggest that CASP8 inhibition in context of ischemic-induced necroptosis relay on other mechanism.
