> TRIP-Br1 oncogenic protein has been shown to have multiple biological functions in cells. In this study, we demonstrate that TRIP-Br1 functions as an oncoprotein by inhibiting autophagy, apoptosis, and necroptosis of cancer cells and eventually helping them to survive under the nutrient/serum starved condition. TRIP-Br1 expression level was significantly increased in conditions with low levels of nutrients. Nutrient depleted conditions were induced by culturing cancer cells until they were overcrowded with high cell density or in media deprived of glucose, amino acids, or serum. Among them, serum starvation significantly enhanced the expression of TRIP-Br1 only in all tested breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, T47D, MDA-MB-435, Hs578D, BT549, and MDA-MB-435) but not in the three normal cell lines (MCF10A, HfCH8, and NIH3T3). As compared with the control cells, the introduction of TRIP-Br1 silencing siRNA into MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells accelerated cell death by inducing apoptosis and necroptosis. In this process, TRIP-Br1 confers resistance to serum starvation-induced cell deaths by stabilizing the XIAP protein and inhibiting cellular ROS production. Moreover, our data also show that the intracellular increase of TRIP-Br1 protein resulting from serum starvation seems to occur in part through the blockage of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

> our results suggest that serum deficiency enhanced the expression of TRIPBr1 oncogenic protein only in cancer cells but not in normal cells. TRIP-Br1 helps cancer cells to survive by suppressing autophagy, apoptosis, and necroptosis.

> Silencing of TRIP-Br1 and XIAP genes  For transient knockdown of TRIP-Br1, the cells were transfected with TRIP-Br1 silencing siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM medium, in which scrambled RNA (scRNA) was used as a nonsilencing control. After 5 hour incubation at 37°C, the transfection medium was replaced with DMEM with Antibiotic-Antimycotic. TRIP-Br1 silencing siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz (Cat#sc-62988). In addition, TRIP-Br1 expression was also silenced with the use of GIPZ Lentiviral shRNA human SERTAD1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Thermo ScientificTM GIPZ LentiviralTM shRNA Library, V2LHS-64483), in which a GIPZ nonsilencing Lentiviral shRNA control vector was used as a nonsilencing control. The TRIPBr1 silenced MCF7 stable cell line was selected with the use of 1 μg/ml of puromycin. For XIAP knock-down, the cells were transfected with XIAP silencing siRNA

> with the use of TurboFect Transfection Reagent (Thermo Scientific, Cat#R0531, Lithuania), in which scRNA acted as a nonsilencing control. After a 24 hour incubation in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic, the transfection medium was replaced with a fresh batch of the same medium. XIAP silencing siRNA was purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (XIAP siRNA I, #6446, U.S.A).

  **HMGB1 is a typical damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that can be passively released during various types of cell death, such as pyroptosis, necrosis, apoptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, NETosis, and lysosome-mediated and autophagy-dependent cell death.**
