> Cancer treatment generally involves drugs used in combinations. Most previous work has focused on identifying and understanding synergistic drug-drug interactions; however, understanding antagonistic interactions remains an important and understudied issue. To enrich for antagonism and reveal common features of these combinations, we screened all pairwise combinations of drugs characterized as activators of regulated cell death. This network is strongly enriched for antagonism, particularly a form of antagonism that we call 'single-agent dominance'. Single-agent dominance refers to antagonisms in which a two-drug combination phenocopies one of the two agents. Dominance results from differences in cell death onset time, with dominant drugs acting earlier than their suppressed counterparts. We explored mechanisms by which parthanatotic agents dominate apoptotic agents, finding that dominance in this scenario is caused by mutually exclusive and conflicting use of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Taken together, our study reveals death kinetics as a predictive feature of antagonism, due to inhibitory crosstalk between cell death pathways.

> Generally, previous studies have focused on identifying combinations that produce synergistic drug–drug interactions. In contrast to expectations, recent reports demonstrate that synergy is not observed in clinically efficacious drug combinations, in which the drugs instead are typically additive or act independently6.

> In recent years, it has become clear that at least 12 mechanistically distinct forms of cell death exist16. Because these death pathways function in a mutually exclusive manner, we reasoned that drug combinations designed to co-activate multiple types of cell death might be enriched for antagonistic interactions

> Several lines of evidence exist to suggest negative interaction and/or interdependent and mutually exclusive function among the various forms of cell death17,18. For instance, necroptosis requires inhibition of extrinsic apoptosis due to cleavage of the pro-necroptotic receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) by caspase-8 (ref. 19). Similarly, PARP1, the initiator of parthanatos, is cleaved by caspase-3, suggesting that apoptosis inhibits the ability to activate parthanatos20.

> Modeling lethal fraction kinetics. Using the procedure above, an LF measurement can be experimentally determined only at 0 and 48 h (Supplementary Fig. 1a). To determine LF at intermediate time points, it was necessary to estimate the growth of the drug-treated cells from 0 to 48 h, as the number of dead cells can in some cases produce false insights (for example, for drugs that induce potent cell death very quickly at high doses and more slowly at low doses, lower doses can yield more dead cells; Supplementary Fig. 1b). Although the population size at the beginning (y0) and end (y48) of the assay is experimentally determined, some ambiguity exists regarding the shape/kinetics of population growth in the drugtreated conditions (that is, the dynamics of population growth as cells respond to the drug; Supplementary Fig. 1c). We considered the ‘area of ambiguity’ for population growth to be constrained by two assumptions: (1) the population size (for example, live and dead cells) is never less than observed in the initial measurement (y0) and (2) the population size is never greater than observed in the final measurement (y48). Assumptions 1 and 2 are met if dead cells can be measured using SYTOX (that is, dead cells do not decay to the point that they are no longer SYTOX positive) and live cells can be observed by STYOX following Triton permeabilization. These assumptions were met in our data due to the relatively short duration of our study (48 h) and the durability of SYTOX fluorescence, which we and others find to be stable for at least 72 h21. For simplicity we used an exponential population growth model, which assumes a uniform rate of growth over time (Supplementary Fig. 1d). In the context of drug treatment, the growth rate is generally decreased, and this is observable in the cell data before and after permeabilization with Triton cell data, which are constrained by the experimentally observed minimum and maximum total cell numbers at the beginning and end of the assay. From the growth curve, the total number of cells could be determined for each condition at any time between 0 and 48 h. Together with dead cell counts, LF was determined for each drug at all time points and doses measured. Kinetic LFs were modeled using a lag exponential death equation described previously21:  LFðtÞ 1⁄4 LF0 þ LFp � LF0  ́ ð1 � e�DR t�DO  ð ÞÞ  where LF0 is the lethal fraction at time 0, LFp is the death plateau, DO is the onset time of death, and DR is the maximum rate of death. The model was constrained by 0 < DO < 48, LFp < 1 and DR < 2. LF0 was left unconstrained to allow for variation in basal levels of cell death. Drugs that did not produce LFmax values two times greater than the LFmax value for DMSO-treated samples were fit to a linear model. Notably, this approach makes an assumption about uniform exponential growth for drug-treated cells; however, assay accuracy does not depend on the uniform growth rate assumption. We also tested in 24 population growth models, including many that were not exponential and many with non-uniform growth rates over time, to determine a possible range for LF kinetics (Supplementary Fig. 1d). In general, death kinetic terms (DO and DR) were invariant regardless of the  population growth model chosen for non-lethal drugs and death-inducing drugs at low and high concentrations. Some variation was observed at intermediate doses for death-inducing drugs, and variation was largest for drugs with particularly early death onset times, as fluctuations in the growth model alter death rates and death plateau values. These data are reported as confidence intervals for death kinetic parameters in Supplementary Dataset 1.

> Classification of drug mechanisms of cell death. Drugs were classified as nonlethal, apoptotic and non-apoptotic. Non-lethal compounds were those that did not induce significant cell killing over background even at the highest doses tested. Significant killing was defined in this study based on the LFmax observed at the assay endpoint. More specifically, the LF values for DMSO treatment reached ~8% at the end of the assay, so drugs were categorized as non-lethal if they induced less than 16% death at their maximum concentration at 48 h. In our kinetic evaluation, these drugs fit to a linear model rather than a lag exponential death model, consistent with the lack of any observable drug-induced increase in the rate of cell killing. For the remaining 45 drugs, apoptotic and non-apoptotic classes were distinguished using a two-pronged approach, with either quantitative thresholds or a multivariate analysis of our pharmacological and kinetic data. Both approaches focused on differences in the measured death between WT and BAX/BAK DKO cells. For the threshold-based strategy, we characterized apoptotic drugs as those in which the LFmax observed in our data in DKO cells was decreased by greater than 50% relative to WT cells (that is, where the death was mostly apoptotic). To validate these classifications, and to validate the use of a 50% threshold (essentially to avoid the use of any thresholds), we also analyzed the full complement of pharmacological and kinetic data for each drug with PCA. PC1 captured response features related to potency (Emax, LFmax, etc.), whereas PC2 captured the degree to which responses were changed in DKO versus WT cells (that is, DKO/WT ratio; Supplementary Fig. 3f). Drug classifications based on a 50% difference in DKO versus WT LFmax were consistent with PCA projections and also with other data dimensionality reduction methods, such as t-SNE. Of note, both PCA- and t-SNE-based analyses identified two different groups within the apoptotic class. For 17 drugs, responses were completely lost in DKO cells (that is, both kinetic and dose–response curves fit to a linear model). For the remaining 17 apoptotic drugs, measures of drug response were diminished in DKO cells, although not as dramatically (Supplementary Fig. 3e; two groups of apoptotic drugs with respect to death onset times in DKO cells). In our analyses, these classes were combined into one apoptotic class for simplicity. See also Supplementary Dataset 1.

> Calculating drug–drug interactions. Drug–drug interactions were calculated using the Chou–Talalay method (CI) and the DBI. The response data used were 1 − LF (that is, with the LF measurement represented in terms of the viable fraction). CI was calculated according to the convention:  CI 1⁄4 DA  dA  þ DB  dB  where da and db are the IC50 doses of drug A (alone) and drug B (alone), and DA and DB refer to the doses of drugs A and B in the A + B combination that resulted in an IC50 response. A similar calculation was performed using the EC50 of A, B and the A + B combination, as well as the GR50 (dose of 50% growth reduction). For the GR index, the relative viability (live cells in drug-treated versus vehicle-treated conditions) was used rather than 1 – LF based on the established convention for the GR index50. In figures where a dose curve is shown for a predicted additive drug response, the curve was estimated using three-parameter logistic regression, with the EC50 set to the predicted IC50 at CI = 1, Emax set to the minimum observed between drugs A and B, and the hill slope set to the mean of hill slopes for drugs A and B. For DBI, the expected response at each dose was computed according to the BI convention:  Bliss expected response 1⁄4 RA þ RB � ðRA  ́ RBÞ  where RA and RB refer to the LF observed at each dose for drugs A and B. The Bliss expected response at each dose was then fit to a logistic regression model. DBI was computed as:  DBI 1⁄4 ðAOC Bliss expected responseÞ  ðAOC observed responseÞ  where the AOC was computed for the observed data and the Bliss expected dose–response curve. For each of the methods described above, thresholds for non-additive interactions were determined by comparing the error among biological replicates. Specifically, CI or DBI scores were computed from each replicate separately. Replicate 1 was selected as ‘true’ and the threshold for drug-drug interaction was iteratively increased from 1 to 10 (for antagonism) or decreased from 1 to 0 (for synergy). This process was repeated using every other replicate as true and evaluating ‘hit’ specificity using replicate 1. Threshold values for interaction were selected at values where false-positive rates were below 5%. Thresholds and numbers of positive/negative interactions are shown in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 7.

> Quantitative identification of drug combinations featuring single-agent  dominance. To identify drug combinations that feature SAD in a quantitative and unbiased manner, we quantified the Euclidean distance between the pharmacological dose curves for every drug combination and its component drugs. A drug was considered dominant if the distance between a drug combination and its closest single drug was less than two times the error rate observed in our assay (that is, less than ~12% variation). This process also selects relatively trivial versions of dominance where the suppressed drug was inefficacious. Thus, we also did not allow suppressed drugs to result in less than 16% killing (the same threshold used to define non-lethal compounds). Using this approach, dominant antagonism was observed for 130 combinations when CI was used to define antagonism and 159 combinations when DBI was used to define antagonism. See also Supplementary Datasets 3 and 4. 

# 🔹 **A. Кінетичні концепти (база статті)**

### **1. Death kinetics shape drug interactions**

- Швидші шляхи смерті можуть пригнічувати повільніші.
    
- “Single-agent dominance” (SAD) → коли комбінація _фенокопіює_ один агент.
    

### **2. Death onset time (DO) як ключовий предиктор**

- Ранній DO = домінування.
    
- Пізній DO = пригнічується.
    

### **3. Death rate (DR)**

- Максимальна швидкість смерті.
    
- Важливо для slope, але менше впливає на SAD, ніж DO.
    

### **4. LF kinetics як база**

- Вони повторюють LED-модель (як у Forcina).
    
- LF(t), LFmax, AUC важливі для кінетичної інтерпретації.

# 🔹 **B. Кінетичний механізм антагонізму**

### **5. Pathway exclusivity (взаємне виключення шляхів смерті)**

- Апоптоз → caspase cleavage of RIPK1 → блокує некроптоз.
    
- Caspase-3 cleaves PARP1 → блокує parthanatos.
    
- Тобто pathways часто _взаємно інгібують_.
    

Це база SAD.

### **6. PARP1 as shared limiting factor**

- PARP1 потрібен для parthanatos.
    
- Caspase-3 розрізає PARP1 → apoptosis dominates and suppresses parthanatos.
    
- Один шлях «висмоктує» ресурс іншого.

# 🔹 **C. Математичне та кінетичне моделювання**

### **7. LED model в Richards = та ж LF-модель**

Однакові параметри:

- LF₀
    
- LFP
    
- DO
    
- DR
    

### **8. Population growth ambiguity problem**

Важливо розуміти:

- Якщо ти рахуєш лише dead cells → можеш отримати фальшиві висновки.
    
- Вони вводять **area of ambiguity** між y₀ і y₄₈ для population size.
    
- Вибирають **exponential growth model** (для простоти).
    
- Але перевіряли **24 різні growth models**, і DO/DR були стійкими.
    

Це ключове — DO і DR **незалежні від моделі росту**.

# 🔹 **D. Кінетична класифікація ліків**

### **9. Нелетальні vs апоптозні vs не-апоптозні агенти**

Вони класифікують агентів за:

1. LFmax (<16% → non-lethal)
    
2. WT vs BAX/BAK DKO
    
3. PCA / t-SNE класи
    
4. LF kinetics (DO, DR)
    

### **10. Rapid-onset vs slow-onset займає центральне місце**

Це важливо для прогнозування SAD.

---

# 🔹 **E. Drug–drug interaction theory**

### **11. Chou–Talalay Combination Index (CI)**

Класичний synergy/antagonism метод.  
Використовують _1 − LF_ як viability.

### **12. Bliss Independence (BI) → DBI**

Розрахунок очікуваних ефектів незалежності.  
DBI = AOC_expected / AOC_observed.

### **13. Replicate-based thresholds**

- Вони не беруть класичні теоретичні пороги.
    
- Пороги CI/DBI визначають на основі **реплік**, щоб уникати false positives.
    
- Наприклад, antagonism = CI > X (визначено емпірично).
    

Це дуже важливо для коректності.

---

# 🔹 **F. Single-Agent Dominance (SAD)**

### **14. SAD definition**

Комбінація **фенокопіює** один агент.

### **15. Euclidean distance approach**

- Distance(combination curve, drug A curve)
    
- If < threshold → A dominates.
    
- Threshold = 2× error of assay (~12%).
    

### **16. Conditions to exclude trivial dominance**

- suppressed drug must cause ≥16% killing alone  
    (інакше «dominated» — просто нелетальний агент)
    

### **17. Результат: >130–150 реальних SAD випадків**

І це поширеніше, ніж synergy.

---

# 🔹 **G. Біологічна інтерпретація SAD**

### **18. Pathway crosstalk explains SAD**

- Parthanatotic agents dominate apoptosis.
    
- Caspase inhibitors rescue dominated pathways.
    
- PARP1 є обмежуючим фактором.
    

### **19. Timing predicts dominance**

Не механізм, а **кінетика**.

Це головний message статті.
