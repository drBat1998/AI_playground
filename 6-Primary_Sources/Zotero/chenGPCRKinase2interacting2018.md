> GPCR kinase 2-interacting protein-1 (GIT1) is a scaffold protein that plays an important role in cell adaptation, proliferation, migration, and differentiation; however, the role of GIT1 in the regulation of neuronal death after spinal cord injury remains obscure. Here, we demonstrate that GIT1 deficiency remarkably increased neuronal apoptosis and enhanced JNK/p38 signaling, which resulted in stronger motor deficits by ischemia-reperfusion in vivo, consistent with the finding of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced neuronal injury in vitro. After treatment with JNK and p38 inhibitors, abnormally necroptotic cell death caused by GIT1 knockdown could be partially rescued, with the recovery of neuronal viability, which was still poorer than that in control neurons. Meanwhile, overactivation of JNK/p38 after GIT1 depletion was concomitant with excessive activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) that could be abolished by ASK1 silencing in HEK293T cells. Finally, GIT1 could disrupt the oligomerization of ASK1 via interaction between the synaptic localization domain that contains the coiled-coil (CC)-2 domain of GIT1 and the C-terminal CC domain of ASK1. It suppressed the autophosphorylation of ASK1 and led to decreasing activity of the ASK1/JNK/p38 pathway. These data reveal a protective role for GIT1 in neuronal damage by modulating ASK1/JNK/p38 signaling.-Chen, J., Wang, Q., Zhou, W., Zhou, Z., Tang, P.-Y., Xu, T., Liu, W., Li, L.-W., Cheng, L., Zhou, Z.-M., Fan, J., Yin, G.-Y.

> Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1), an MAPK kinase kinase (MKK), plays essential roles in stressinduced apoptosis (6, 7). ASK1 is activated in response to a variety of stress-related stimuli, including proinflammatory factors, reactive oxygen species, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and calcium influx, through distinct mechanisms, and it activates MKK4 and MKK3, which, in turn, activate JNK and p38 (6, 8–13). Previous studies have demonstrated that the ASK1/JNK/p38 pathway that is activated by stress-related stimuli was involved in neuronal apoptosis after SCI induced by I/R injury (14–17).

> Lentiviral vector production  Mouse GIT1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) target sequences were as follows: shRNA 1: 59-CGATCAACTCACGGTCATACT-39,  shRNA 2: 59-CCCTCTAGGTGTTTAACGTCCGTCT-39, and shRNA 3: 59-CGGTTCTACTACCTCAGTTT-39. An additional scrambled sequence (59-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTAA-39) was also designed as a negative control (NC). The lentiviruscontaining mouse GIT1 shRNAs (sh-GIT1 1, 2, and 3) or NC shRNA (sh-Scr) were packaged using the pHB vector. Human GIT1 shRNA target sequences were as follows: shRNA 1: 59GATCACAAGAATGGGCATT-39, shRNA 2: 59-CACCTTGATCATCGACATT-39, and shRNA 3: 59-TGCTCAGAGAAGATCCATT-39. An additional scrambled sequence (59-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-39) was also designed as NC. The lentiviruscontaining human GIT1 shRNAs (sh-GIT1 1, 2, and 3) or NC shRNA (sh-Scr) were packaged using the GV112 vector.  siRNA production  Annealed oligonucleotides that corresponded to target sequences for the human ASK1 sequence (59-GCACUCCUUCAUCGAGCUA-39) (46) and an additional scrambled sequence (59-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAdTdT-39) were obtained from GenePharma (Shanghai, China).

> Plasmid production  Full-length sequences for human GIT1 and ASK1 were subcloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the Flag-, His-, or Myctagged pcDNA3.1 vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RT-PCR was used to clone cDNAs for GIT1 (1–250 aa), GIT1 (1–420 aa), GIT1 (1–620 aa), GIT1 (620–770 aa), GIT1 ΔCC2 (lacking the SLDcontained CC2 present in aa 421–619), and ASK1 ΔCC (lacking the CC domain present in aa 1294–12351) into corresponding vectors. For synthetic oligomerization, 3 copies of FKBP12, followed by the His tag (FKBP3-His), were also introduced at the 59 end of human ASK1 in the pcDNA3.1 vector. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Primers used to generate these constructs and vectors are listed in Supplemental Table 1.

> Co-IP  After treatments, cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice for 20 min in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 12 mM glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mg/ml leupeptin). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and supernatants were immunoprecipitated with the indicated Abs specific for co-IP using protein A/G Magnetic Beads. Beads were washed 3 times with buffer A and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting analysis.
