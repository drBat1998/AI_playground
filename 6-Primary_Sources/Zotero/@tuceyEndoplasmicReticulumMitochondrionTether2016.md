> The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans escapes macrophages by triggering NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent host cell death (pyroptosis). Pyroptosis is inflammatory and must be tightly regulated by host and microbe, but the mechanism is incompletely defined. We characterized the C. albicans endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrion tether ERMES and show that the ERMES mmm1 mutant is severely crippled in killing macrophages despite hyphal formation and normal phagocytosis and survival. To understand dynamic inflammasome responses to Candida with high spatiotemporal resolution, we established live-cell imaging for parallel detection of inflammasome activation and pyroptosis at the single-cell level. This showed that the inflammasome response to mmm1 mutant hyphae is delayed by 10 h, after which an exacerbated activation occurs. The NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 inhibited inflammasome activation and pyroptosis by C. albicans, including exacerbated inflammasome activation by the mmm1 mutant. At the cell biology level, inactivation of ERMES led to a rapid collapse of mitochondrial tubular morphology, slow growth and hyphal elongation at host temperature, and reduced exposed 1,3-β-glucan in hyphal populations. Our data suggest that inflammasome activation by C. albicans requires a signal threshold dependent on hyphal elongation and cell wall remodeling, which could fine-tune the response relative to the level of danger posed by C. albicans. The phenotypes of the ERMES mutant and the lack of conservation in animals suggest that ERMES is a promising antifungal drug target. Our data further indicate that NLRP3 inhibition by MCC950 could modulate C. albicans-induced inflammation. IMPORTANCE The yeast Candida albicans causes human infections that have mortality rates approaching 50%. The key to developing improved therapeutics is to understand the host-pathogen interface. A critical interaction is that with macrophages: intracellular Candida triggers the NLRP3/caspase-1 inflammasome for escape through lytic host cell death, but this also activates antifungal responses. To better understand how the inflammasome response to Candida is fine-tuned, we established live-cell imaging of inflammasome activation at single-cell resolution, coupled with analysis of the fungal ERMES complex, a mitochondrial regulator that lacks human homologs. We show that ERMES mediates Candida escape via inflammasome-dependent processes, and our data suggest that inflammasome activation is controlled by the level of hyphal growth and exposure of cell wall components as a proxy for severity of danger. Our study provides the most detailed dynamic analysis of inflammasome responses to a fungal pathogen so far and establishes promising pathogen- and host-derived therapeutic strategies.

> Macrophages treated with heat-killed Candida and the compounds MCC950 and MCC6642 survived normally in the assay, demonstrating that these molecules do not have adverse effects on macrophage cell survival. ASC speck formation was monitored dynamically over time by live-cell microscopy, and macrophage cell death was monitored simultaneously using the membrane-impermeant DNA-staining dye DRAQ7. Initial experiments revealed that imaging in one plane of focus was not sufficient to capture all ASC speck formation events. Therefore, to ensure that all forming ASC specks were captured in multiple planes of focus, z-stacks spaced 8.5 m part, totaling 42.5 m, were taken in time-lapse images.

> ortalized mCerulean-tagged ASC inflammasome reporter macrophages were a gift from Eicke Latz (36). Live-cell imaging was set up as described above, and the MOI was 3:1 (Candida cells to macrophage). The acquisition of time-lapse images, methods for processing, and counting of ASC speck formation are described in Text S1 in the supplemental material. All macrophage experiments (with BMDMs and ASC-Cerulean macrophages) were done in the presence of 2.5 mM methionine and 0.5 mM cysteine in the medium to allow for MMM1 gene repression. Heat-killed Candida cells were incubated at 80°C for 1 h prior to addition to macrophages. For experiments including drug treatments, 10 M MCC950 or 10 M MCC6642 (both made as 10 mM stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) or 10 M nigericin (Invitrogen) was included at the same time as addition of Candida. 

Tucey and colleagues used live-cell imaging to detect pyroptosis in macrophages. They employed mCerulean-tagged ASC inflammasome reporter macrophages together with DRAQ7-positive rupture scoring, allowing them to distinguish inflammasome activation from the execution phase of pyroptosis.
