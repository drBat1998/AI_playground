> Apoptosis and necroptosis are two regulated cell death mechanisms; however, the interaction between these cell death pathways in vivo is unclear. Here we used cerebral ischemia/reperfusion as a model to investigate the interaction between apoptosis and necroptosis. We show that the activation of RIPK1 sequentially promotes necroptosis followed by apoptosis in a temporally specific manner. Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion insult rapidly activates necroptosis to promote cerebral hemorrhage and neuroinflammation. Ripk3 deficiency reduces cerebral hemorrhage and delays the onset of neural damage mediated by inflammation. Reduced cerebral perfusion resulting from arterial occlusion promotes the degradation of TAK1, a suppressor of RIPK1, and the transition from necroptosis to apoptosis. Conditional knockout of TAK1 in microglial/infiltrated macrophages and neuronal lineages sensitizes to ischemic infarction by promoting apoptosis. Taken together, our results demonstrate the critical role of necroptosis in mediating neurovascular damage and hypoperfusion-induced TAK1 loss, which subsequently promotes apoptosis and cerebral pathology in stroke and neurodegeneration.

> n immunoblot analysis of brain lysates from WT mice after ischemic insult, p-T231/S232 RIPK3 and p-S345 MLKL were detected immediately on reperfusion and remained elevated until ∼5 h after the onset of reperfusion (Fig. 2A)

> Reperfusion after ischemic occlusion is essential for the activation of necroptosis, as p-MLKL was not detected in the ischemic brains without reperfusion (a permanent occlusion stroke model) (Fig. 2 B and C).

> In addition to necroptosis, the cleavage of caspase-3, the biomarker of apoptosis, was also detected in ischemic brains, peaking at 24 h after the ischemic insult (Fig. 2A).
