> BACKGROUND: Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, an inevitable complication in hepatic surgery, significantly compromises patient outcomes. Hypoxia-induced hepatocyte death is a critical early event that triggers inflammatory cascades and leads to organ damage during ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Necroptosis is widely recognized as a form of regulated cell death. Here, we show that hypoxia activates ZBP1, an intracellular Z-DNA sensor protein, leading to intrinsic necroptosis in hepatocytes.
METHODS: We established a hepatic ischemia-reperfusion mouse model and a primary hepatocyte hypoxia-reoxygenation system. Moreover, we applied gene interference and conditional knockout to investigate the molecular mechanism.
RESULTS: We found that hepatic ischemia-reperfusion specifically induced RIP3-dependent necroptosis in hepatocytes, rather than non-parenchymal cells. The specific knockout of RIP3 in hepatocytes or the use of RIP3 inhibitor significantly alleviated hepatocyte death and reduced inflammatory response. Moreover, hypoxic conditions alone were sufficient to induce RIP3-dependent necroptosis in hepatocytes, with reoxygenation being dispensable. Mechanistically, our results showed that hypoxia resulted in mitochondrial damage and Z-DNA accumulation, thereby activating ZBP1/RIP3 signaling. Mitochondrial protectant, mitochondrial DNA remover, or the knockdown of ZBP1 rescued hepatocytes from necroptosis. Furthermore, AAV8-ZBP1-shRNA infection completely blocked hepatocyte necroptosis and mitigated hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury. Taken together, we found that mitochondrial DNA damage leads to hepatocyte ZBP1/RIP3-dependent necroptosis, aggravating ischemia-reperfusion injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we reveal that hypoxia-induced mitochondrial Z-DNA/ZBP1/RIP3-dependent necroptosis acts as a key driver in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, expanding the knowledge on the mechanism of hypoxia-induced hepatocyte death. Crucially, therapeutic targeting Z-DNA/ZBP1/RIP3 signaling significantly attenuated hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, providing preclinical evidence for clinical translation.

> When the mitochondria structure is compromised, mtDNA is released into the  cytoplasm or extracellular space, functioning as a proinflammatory substance [25]. Importantly,  closed circular mtDNA, unlike genomic DNA, could not relieve the torsional strain. Under  oxidative stress, mtDNA may turn into left-handed Z-form DNA (Z-DNA) [24,26]

> Given that mitochondria-sourced Z-form DNA (Z-DNA) is an intracellular endogenous ligand of  ZBP1, we examined Z-DNA using Z-DNA antibody and TOM20, a mitochondrial marker. We  observed that a large number of Z-DNA co-located at mitochondria at the early stage of hypoxia  (Fig. 6E).

> . Moreover, ddC or MitoQ  inhibited the binding of ZBP1 to RIP3 and blocked the activation of ZBP1/RIP3/MLKL signaling  (Fig. 7D-E). Taken together, we suggested that hypoxia-mediated mitochondrial damage and ZDNA production activated ZBP1/RIP3-dependent necroptosis signaling.

> . Our findings demonstrated that  ZBP1 also plays an intrinsic regulator in non-immune cells, determining cell fate. A recent report  showed an amplification loop between ZBP1 and STING that both of them are pattern receptors  sensing mitochondrial DNA [49], but in fact, both previous study and our unpublished data showed  that STING is deficient in hepatocytes [50]. We suggest that ZBP1 is a unique sensor in hepatocytes  for the detection of scathing mitochondrial DNA.

> Mitochondrial ROS serve as a key trigger for mitochondrial damage in hypoxic cells.  Hypoxia disrupts the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to electron leakage and an  increase in mitochondrial ROS production [18]. Evidence proved that mitochondrial ROS is a  platform which contributes to promoting necroptosis [53].

> Although reoxygenation could aggravate the generation of mitochondrial ROS [18], our study  showed that a period of hypoxia, no more than 1.5 h, is sufficient to cause mitochondrial ROS and  sufficient to mediate hepatocyte necroptosis both in vivo and in vitro. This finding highlights the  need for significant attention even to brief episodes of hypoxia, due to the important clinical  implications
