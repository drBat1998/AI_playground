> Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) contributes to necroptosis. Our previous study showed that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of RIPK1 protects against ischemic stroke-induced astrocyte injury. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying RIPK1-mediated astrocyte injury in vitro and in vivo. Primary cultured astrocytes were transfected with lentiviruses and then subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). In a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO), lentiviruses carrying shRNA targeting RIPK1 or shRNA targeting heat shock protein 70.1B (Hsp70.1B) were injected into the lateral ventricles 5 days before pMCAO was established. We showed that RIPK1 knockdown protected against OGD-induced astrocyte damage, blocked the OGD-mediated increase in lysosomal membrane permeability in astrocytes, and inhibited the pMCAO-induced increase in astrocyte lysosome numbers in the ischemic cerebral cortex; these results suggested that RIPK1 contributed to the lysosomal injury in ischemic astrocytes. We revealed that RIPK1 knockdown upregulated the protein levels of Hsp70.1B and increased the colocalization of Lamp1 and Hsp70.1B in ischemic astrocytes. Hsp70.1B knockdown exacerbated pMCAO-induced brain injury, decreased lysosomal membrane integrity and blocked the protective effects of the RIPK1-specific inhibitor necrostatin-1 on lysosomal membranes. On the other hand, RIPK1 knockdown further exacerbated the pMCAO- or OGD-induced decreases in the levels of Hsp90 and the binding of Hsp90 to heat shock transcription factor-1 (Hsf1) in the cytoplasm, and RIPK1 knockdown promoted the nuclear translocation of Hsf1 in ischemic astrocytes, resulting in increased Hsp70.1B mRNA expression. These results suggest that inhibition of RIPK1 protects ischemic astrocytes by stabilizing lysosomal membranes via the upregulation of lysosomal Hsp70.1B; the mechanism underlying these effects involves decreased Hsp90 protein levels, increased Hsf1 nuclear translocation and increased Hsp70.1B mRNA expression.

> Heat shock protein 70.1 (Hsp70.1) is a major protein of the human Hsp70 family. Hsp70.1 mainly functions as a chaperone that allows cells to cope with harmful aggregates of denatured proteins during and after exposure to various insults, such as heat, ischemia, and other oxidative stresses [19, 20]. In addition to the role of chaperones in protecting cells from the effects of damaged proteins, Hsp70.1, which is localized to the lysosomal membrane, is known to stabilize lysosomal membranes by recycling damaged proteins and protecting cells from oxidative stresses [21–23].

Therefore, Hsp70.1 is a modulator of lysosomal rupture/permeabilization after ischemia–reperfusion injury

> Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and heat shock transcription factor-1 (Hsf1) act as coregulators that promote the expression of Hsp70 family proteins [25]. Normally, Hsp90 interacts with Hsf1 to form a chaperone complex in the cytoplasm, and its binding to Hsp90 inhibits the nuclear translation of Hsf1. During ischemia, Hsf1 can be released from the cytoplasmic Hsp90 complex, and Hsf1 forms its own trimer, which has DNA binding ability, enters the nucleus, binds to DNA and promotes the expression of Hsp70 protein family members.

> A large number of studies have shown that Hsp90 plays an important role in the stability and normal function of RIPK1 [26–28]. Activated molecular chaperone complexes composed of Hsp90 and CDC37 regulate the formation of RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL complexes, therefore, regulating necroptosis in cells, and Hsp90 inhibitors can inhibit the occurrence of necroptosis [29, 30].

Primary cortical astrocyte cultures were prepared from 24 h postnatal SD rats as previously described [16]. Briefly, the cerebral cortices were digested with 2.5% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C and filtered through a sterile 40 μm nylon cell strainer. The cells were suspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 (1:1) (11330, Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (10099, Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (C0222, Beyotime, China) solution. The cells were maintained at 37 °C under >90% humidity in 5% CO2. The medium was changed every 2–3 days until the cells reached confluence. The population of cells obtained with this procedure included more than 95% astrocytes, which were positive for glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) staining.

> he mechanisms involved in the RIPK1/ RIPK3/MLKL cascade activation-mediated LMP increase include the following: (1) Phosphorylated MLKL translocates to the plasma  membrane, leading to Ca2+ influx. ER stress, as a result of RIPK3  and MLKL phosphorylation, causes Ca2+ dysregulation. Increased  Ca2+ concentrations activate Ca2+-dependent enzymes in the cytosol, particularly calpains and cPLA2, which can then increase LMP. (2) Mitochondria- and NOX-dependent ROS induce increased LMP. The generation of ROS relies on necrosomal RIPK3, which in turn facilitates RIPK1 autophosphorylation. Subsequently, disrupted lysosomes release acidic hydrolases (especially cathepsins B and D) into the cytoplasm, resulting in plasma membrane permeability and eventual necroptosis. (3) Lysosomes are essential for the posttranslational regulation of RIPK1 and RIPK3, which guarantees the occurrence of necroptosis. O

> Both Hsp70.1A and Hsp70.1B are subtypes of Hsp70.1, and they are more than 99% identical, sharing all but two of their 641 amino acids. Basal HSPA1A and HSPA1B mRNA expressions slightly differ in most tissues, with somewhat higher  HSPA1A expression in most tissues and cell types. However, the change in the HSPA1B mRNA levels is more obvious than that of the HSPA1A mRNA levels during human traumatic brain injury [55]. In this study, we found that RIPK1 knockdown protected astrocytes against OGD-induced damage, inhibited the pMCAOinduced increase in the number of astrocyte lysosomes in the ischemic cerebral cortex, and blocked the OGD-mediated increase in LMP in astrocytes; these results suggested that RIPK1 contributes to lysosomal injury in ischemic astrocytes. Further study showed that RIPK1 knockdown upregulated the protein levels of Hsp70.1B and increased the colocalization

> The mechanisms underlying the inhibition of RIPK1-mediated lysosomal Hsp70.1B upregulation What is the mechanism by which RIPK1 inhibition increases the Hsp70.1B levels at the lysosomal membrane? Under nonstress conditions, Hsp90 interacts with Hsf1 to form a molecular chaperone complex in the cytoplasm and inhibits the nuclear translocation of Hsf1. Under stress conditions, Hsf1 can be activated in a variety of ways. Hsp90 depletion leads to significant activation of Hsf1 [38, 39]. Activated Hsf1 forms a trimeric complex that translocates to the nucleus and binds to elements in the Hsp70 gene promoter, resulting in a rapid increase in the expression of Hsp70 [40]. The most intriguing discovery of the present study is that RIPK1 knockdown further enhanced pMCAO- or OGD-induced decreases in the levels of Hsp90, leading to attenuated Hsp90 binding to Hsf1 in the cytoplasm, promoting the translocation of Hsf1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and in turn, increasing Hsp70.1B mRNA and protein expression. The most abundant heat shock protein, namely, Hsp90, has been characterized as a molecular chaperone that modulates both the structure and function of associated proteins, which are called clients. Numerous  kinases and pseudokinases are Hsp90 clients, and these proteins form complexes with Hsp90 and its cochaperone CDC37 [56]. Loss of Hsp90 function likely causes the destabilization and degradation of its clients via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. A previous study demonstrated that RIPK1 is an Hsp90 client [57]. Inhibition of Hsp90 function by a specific inhibitor, namely, geldanamycin, disrupts the association between Hsp90 and RIPK1, which results in the degradation of RIPK1 and the subsequent inhibition of TNFmediated IκB kinase and NF-κB activation [57]. In contrast, we found that ischemia decreased Hsp90, and inhibition of RIPK1 enhanced this ischemia-mediated decrease in the Hsp90 levels in astrocytes. Similarly, Yu et al. reported that treatment with Nec-1 decreased the Hsp90 protein levels during TNF-α-, Smac mimetic- and ZVADinduced human pulmonary artery endothelial cell necroptosis [31]. In addition, Nec-1 also decreased the binding of Hsp90 to RIPK1/ RIPK3/MLKL [30, 31]. Our data and those of others indicate that the interaction of RIPK1 and Hsp90 causes them to stabilize each other, and inhibition of either of these two proteins leads to the instability and degradation of the other protein. However, what is the detailed molecular mechanism underlying this role of RIPK1? Ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification that is related to the function of Hsp90. Blank et al. demonstrated increased Hsp90 ubiquitination after treatment with the photodynamic signal transduction inhibitor

> hypericin [58]. This increased ubiquitination suppressed Hsp90 chaperone function and increased the degradation of Hsp90specific clients. Another study by Neckers et al. showed that Swe1mediated phosphorylation of Hsp90 promotes its ubiquitination and targets Hsp90 for degradation [59]. Based on these previous findings, we reasonably speculate that inhibition of RIPK1 might result in the phosphorylation of Hsp90, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation and leading to decreased Hsp90 levels. This mechanism remains to be investigated in the very near future. In summary, the significant findings of this current study on ischemic stroke include the following: (1) lysosomal Hsp70.1B, which is regulated by RIPK1, plays a key role in ischemic strokeinduced astrocytic lysosomal membrane damage. (2) Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of RIPK1 inhibits ischemic strokeinduced lysosomal membrane destabilization through the upregulation of Hsp70.1B at the lysosomal membrane in astrocytes. Knockdown of Hsp70.1B exacerbates ischemic stroke-mediated changes in LMP and brain injury and prevents the Nec-1-mediated protective effects on lysosomal membranes. (3) The mechanism  by which RIPK1 inhibition increases lysosomal Hsp70.1B levels may be associated with an increase in Hsp70.1B transcription; this occurs via RIPK1 knockdown-mediated exacerbation of ischemic stroke-induced decreases in the cytoplasmic levels of Hsp90 and its interaction with Hsf1, which in turn promotes the nuclear translocation of Hsf1 and increases Hsp70.1B mRNA transcription. One of the limitations of our study is that the shRNA RIPK1 sequence we used was not astrocyte specific; thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the lentivirus carrying shRNA RIPK1, which was injected i.c.v., also affected microglia and oligodendrocytes in the ischemic zone. Further studies using astrocyte-specific genetic disruption of RIPK1 function will be critical in establishing the mechanisms by which RIPK1 inhibition decreases the Hsp90 levels in ischemic stroke pathology (Fig. 10).
