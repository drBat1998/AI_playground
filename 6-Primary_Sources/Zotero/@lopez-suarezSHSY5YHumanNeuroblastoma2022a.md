> Investigation of the toxicity triggered by chemicals on the human brain has traditionally relied on approaches using rodent in vivo models and in vitro cell models including primary neuronal cultures and cell lines from rodents. The issues of species differences between humans and rodents, the animal ethical concerns and the time and cost required for neurotoxicity studies on in vivo animal models, do limit the use of animal-based models in neurotoxicology. In this context, human cell models appear relevant in elucidating cellular and molecular impacts of neurotoxicants and facilitating prioritization of in vivo testing.

  **Neurotoxicity is an disruption of any of the functions and structures of nercous system by exogenous or a mixture of exo and exogenous compounds.**

> The neurotransmitter signature of the differentiated cells depends on the differentiation-agent used. For example, differentiation with retinoic acid (RA) could give rise to a more cholinergic phenotype [33], whereas the use of other agents such as 12-O-tetradecancyl-phorbol-13acetate (TPA), alone or in combination with RA, and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP) can lead to more dopaminergic-adrenergic and adrenergic phenotypes, respectively [17, 19, 26, 34].

> Another problem of differentiation, not only associated with the use of RA but also with other differentiating agents, and that could be of more concern, is the purity of the cell cultures. Despite the SH-SY5Y cell line was selected as a homogenous neuroblastic clone [12], some cells still present an epithelial morphology (Figure 1), and even some cells can undergo interconversion from one type to the other [10, 11, 20]. These epithelial-like cells can become an important percentage in prolonged cell culture, as this cell type does not seem to be affected by postmitotic effects of RA and, after long periods of culture (from 7-10 days of treatment), the cell count on the cultures increases due to an increased proliferation of epithelial-like cells [11].  Aiming to avoid the proliferation of epithelial-like cells in the neuronal cultures, different approaches have been applied. In fact, the addition of several factors to RA during differentiation such as cholesterol [20] or neurotrophic factors as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) [11, 23] have proved to enhance differentiating properties of RA obtaining more neuronal characteristics in the cultures with reduced or nonobserved cells presenting an epithelial morphology.

> Combined treatment of cells with RA and BDNF has proven to enhance RA-induced neuronal differentiation. RA and BDNF differentiated cultures show higher neuronal morphological characteristics and biomarkers [11, 23, 32], expression of gene clusters related to neuronal functionality and morphology [35], and electrophysiological properties of a neuronal model [41].

> 12. SH-SY5Y CELLS IN HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING  Of special interest is the study of Li and collaborators [214]. Framed in the American project Tox21, with the main aim to develop high-throughput screening for toxicity of chemical compounds, Li and collaborators tested more than 8,000 compounds (Tox21 10K compounds collection) for the ability to inhibit AChE activity. They used enzyme- and cell-based approaches with monolayer and spheroid culture of SH-SY5Y cells and neural stem cells for the cell-based testing. SH-SY5Y cells proved to be a good model for the screening of AChE inhibitors, with modest differences of sensitivity to certain compounds between monolayer cultures and spheroids. With the large number of compounds tested covering most, if not all, of the compounds used in this review, a first screening detected 187 compounds (2.25%) capable of inhibiting AChE more than 50%. From these chemicals, they selected 111 compounds that inhibited 50% of AChE activity (IC50) at concentrations lower than 20 μM for further analysis, comprising several organophosphate pesticides, including bromophos and chlorpyrifos among others, several carbamates (for which no other studies with SH-SY5Y cells were found) and the organochlorine pesticide endosulfan. Clustering analysis of the Tox21 compounds library based on the chemical structure revealed clusters of compounds enriched with AChE inhibitors, including a cluster with 21 carbamates and another one with OPs comprising chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxon. Enzyme-based assays revealed that most of the OPs were more potent with metabolic activation by incubation with human microsomes. Further docking studies characterized structural interactions of the compounds with AChE. Overall, high-throughput analysis of AChE inhibition on SH-SY5Y provided data to characterize potential neurotoxic compounds and, together with enzyme-based tests and structural analysis, this data can be used in predictive models of toxicity.  13.
