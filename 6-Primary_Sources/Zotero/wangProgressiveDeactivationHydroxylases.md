> Graded hypoxia is a common microenvironment in malignant solid tumors. As a central regulator in the hypoxic response, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) can induce multiple cellular processes including glycolysis, angiogenesis, and necroptosis. How cells exploit the HIF-1 pathway to coordinate different processes to survive hypoxia remains unclear. We developed an integrated model of the HIF-1α network to elucidate the mechanism of cellular adaptation to hypoxia. By numerical simulations and bifurcation analysis, we found that HIF-1α is progressively activated with worsening hypoxia due to the sequential deactivation of the hydroxylases prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). Bistable switches control the activation and deactivation processes. As a result, glycolysis, immunosuppression, angiogenesis, and necroptosis are orderly elicited in aggravating hypoxia. To avoid the excessive accumulation of lactic acid during glycolysis, HIF-1α induces monocarboxylate transporter and carbonic anhydrase 9 sequentially to export intracellular hydrogen ions, facilitating tumor cell survival. HIF-1α-induced miR-182 facilitates vascular endothelial growth factor production to promote angiogenesis under moderate hypoxia. The imbalance between accumulation and removal of lactic acid in severe hypoxia may result in acidosis and induce cell necroptosis. In addition, the deactivation of FIH results in the destabilization of HIF-1α in anoxia. Collectively, HIF-1α orchestrates the adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxia by selectively inducing its targets according to the severity of hypoxia. Our work may provide clues for tumor therapy by targeting the HIF-1 pathway.

> Sufficient activation of BNIP3 is responsible for hypoxic necroptosis, in which BNIP3 dimerizes and inserts into the mitochondrial membrane to regulate its permeability [78,79]. Although BNIP3 is expressed at various hypoxia levels, it induces cell necroptosis only under severe hypoxia, establishing a scenario in which the expression and activation of BNIP3 are separately regulated [27,45]. This could result from the difficulty in inducing acidosis under mild hypoxia when lactic acid production is negligible. In the absence of acidosis, BNIP3 is unstable and exhibits low affinity to mitochondria [28]. Alternatively, only when BNIP3 accumulates sufficiently can it counteract the formation of heterodimers with Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Bax; indeed, the expression of BNIP3 in severe hypoxia is nearly twice that observed in mild hypoxia [27,28,80]. In addition, BNIP3 could also promote cell survival through autophagy, which emerges under moderate hypoxia [81].

> The role of necroptosis in tumor progression is worth discussing. As an essential hallmark of aggressive tumors, necroptosis promotes cell survival by amplifying HIF-1α signaling as well  as activating the NF-κB and PI3K/mTOR pathways [82].  Consistently, necrotic extracts from dying cells promote migration and invasion of glioblastoma cancer stem cells with reduced oxygen tension [83]. Necrotic lysates enhance endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, promoting cell invasion and migration [84]. Thus, necroptosis may be a strategy for tumor progression, and the necroptosis of individual cells facilitates more robust survival of the tumor cell community. Considering the role of necrotic lysates in promoting tumor vascularization, a cross-link between VEGF and necrotic downstream pathways could be identified [82]. It would be interesting to take into account the inflammatory regulatory pathways to clarify the mechanisms underlying the coordination of necroptosis, inflammation, and hypoxia in tumor progression [83,85–87]. Following VEGF-mediated neovascularization, HIF-1 signaling is attenuated with elevated oxygen pressure, creating a long-range feedback loop between HIF-1, VEGF, and hypoxia detection. Integrating this loop into our model is challenging but intriguing since a considerable portion of tumor cells are subjected to at least 2 cycles of hypoxia [88].

> Our results suggest that cell necroptosis could be avoided by disrupting the expression and activation of BNIP3 or HIF-1 under severe hypoxia. FIH inhibitors could be exploited to destabilize HIF-1α since FIH contributes to the stabilization of  HIF-1α under hypoxia [37]. Alternatively, p53 may be a candidate for inhibiting necroptosis for the following reasons: (a) p53 directly inhibits BNIP3 expression [89]; (b) p53 reduces HIF-1 activity by competing for p300 and induces Mdm2 production to degrade HIF-1 [90,91]; and (c) multiple targets of p53 are associated with the inhibition of glycolysis, which disrupts acidosis and BNIP3 activation [92]. Probing the interplay between p53 and HIF-1 revealed a mechanism for activating p53 under severe hypoxia [93]. Replacing BNIP3-mediated necroptosis with p53-mediated apoptosis may be a viable approach for tumor suppression.
