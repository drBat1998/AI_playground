> Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury constitutes a significant risk factor for a range of diseases, including ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and trauma. Following the restoration of blood flow post-tissue ischemia, oxidative stress can lead to various forms of cell death, including necrosis, apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. Recent evidence has highlighted the crucial role of mitochondrial dysfunction in I/R injury. Nevertheless, there remains much to be explored regarding the molecular signaling network governing cell death under conditions of oxidative stress. Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), a major component in the outer mitochondrial membrane, is closely involved in the regulation of cell death. In a cellular model of oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R), which effectively simulates I/R injury in vitro, our study reveals that OGD/R induces VDAC1 oligomerization, consequently exacerbating cell death. Furthermore, we have revealed the translocation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) to the mitochondria, where it interacts with VDAC1 following OGD/R injury, leading to an increased mitochondrial membrane permeability. Notably, the inhibition of MLKL by necrosulfonamide hinders the binding of MLKL to VDAC1, primarily by affecting the membrane translocation of MLKL, and reduces OGD/R-induced VDAC1 oligomerization. Collectively, our findings provide preliminary evidence of the functional association between MLKL and VDAC1 in the regulation of necroptosis.

> VDAC1 is indispensable for the regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTP), which control the opening of mPTP, leading to the leakage of mitochondrial contents  such as cytochrome c (Cyt c), mtDNA [8–12], intracellular Ca2+, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [13]. Consequently, calcium overload and ROS accumulation can influence cellular function and cell death [9,10,12].

> However, the precise mechanism underlying the death signal upon MLKL activation has not been fully elucidated. Recent studies have suggested that MLKL targets not only the plasma membrane but also various other organelle membranes, including lysosomes, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclei [16,26–28].

> dditionally, MLKL phosphorylation and translocation during OGD/R induced necroptosis in NIH3T3 cells. Two studies showed MLKL translocation and identified MLKL as a prominent molecule related to necroptosis [26,27]. MLKL translocation to the cell membrane can trigger the rupture of the cell membrane and eventually lead to cell death [26–28]. Subsequent studies have shown MLKL translocation to organelles including the mitochondria and nucleus [16,28,57]; however, the biological role of these cellular events is unclear. Herein, we investigated new regulatory mechanisms of programmed necrosis-related pathways in I/R injury and provided new ideas for treating programmed necrosis I/R-related diseases.

> OGD/R-induced mitochondrial damage, which is one of the leading causes of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration imbalance [7,8,12,  61]. Therefore, we associated the effect of MLKL on intracellular Ca2+ concentration changes with mitochondrial damage for a better understanding of I/R injury-related diseases in order to develop new treatment strategies.

> To investigate the regulatory mechanism of MLKL during mitochondrial damage, we isolated mitochondrial proteins interacting with MLKL after OGD/R by performing Co-IP assays and identified them by performing mass spectrometry (our unpublished data). In our study, we found that VDAC1 probably interacted with MLKL. As mentioned, VDAC1 participated in mPTP channel opening by undergoing oligomerization to regulate mitochondrial damage. Additionally, VDAC1 oligomerization increased significantly after OGD/R, whereas NSA inhibited this process and reduced OGD/R-induced mitochondrial damage, ultimately reducing necroptosis. Therefore, we speculate that MLKL may regulate mitochondrial damage by affecting VDAC1 oligomerization to regulate necroptosis. However, the specific interaction of VDAC1 with MLKL should be further investigated in the future.

  **MLKL and pMLKL in mitochondria during I/R is in different level. Maybe it is due to the MLKL and pMLKL have different function in the same context.**
