> Synapse formation is a fundamental process that shapes the connectivity and function of the nervous system, but the mechanisms regulating synaptogenesis are incompletely understood. Moreover, the interplay of these mechanisms at distinct synapse types remains to be defined. Using a scalable optical pooled screening platform, we investigated the process of synapse induction to uncover modulators of a prototypical synapse-organizing adhesion molecule, neuroligin-1. Analysis of over two million single-cell phenotypic profiles identified 102 candidate regulators of neuroligin-1 that are linked to cell adhesion, cytoskeletal dynamics, and signaling. Among these, we show that the phosphatase PTEN and the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein DAG1 promote neuroligin's roles in inducing presynaptic assembly, with DAG1 selectively regulating inhibitory synapses. This work establishes a scalable high-content screening approach for cell-cell interactions that enables systematic studies of the molecular interactions guiding synaptogenesis.

====> Specifically, we focused on identifying modulators of a prototypical synaptic organizer, neuroligin-1 (NLGN1). NLGN1 is a postsynaptic cell adhesion protein that interacts with presynaptic neurexins to regulate synapse assembly and specification.7,27–29 Prior work demonstrated that NLGN1-expressing HEK293T cells induced heterologous synapse formation but not when N-cadherin (CDH2) was knocked out.24 This finding highlighted that synaptogenic CAMs do not act on their own but rather function in cooperation with other proteins.====

[[cell specificity and its importance in your study]]
First, the authors used two types of cells: neurons and non-neuronal cells with overexpression of a specific cell adhesion protein. Second, genetic profiling was used to study not only the protein but also the proteins and pathways that interact with it deeply.
