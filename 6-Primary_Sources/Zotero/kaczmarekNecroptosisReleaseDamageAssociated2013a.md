> Because the nomenclature of DAMPs in the literature is confusing, here we define DAMPs as a family of molecules that are intracellular in physiological conditions and can be divided into two groups: (1) molecules that perform noninflammatory functions in living cells (such as HMGB1, ATP) and acquire immunomodulatory properties when released, secreted, modified, or exposed on the cell surface during cellular stress, damage, or injury (Rock and Kono, 2008), or (2) alarmins, i.e., molecules that possess cytokine-like functions (such as IL-1a and IL-33), which can be stored in cells and released upon cell lysis, whereupon they contribute to the inflammatory response (Oppenheim and Yang, 2005) (Tables 1 and 2).

> In addition, full-length IL-33 is released during necrosis, but during apoptosis it can undergo caspasedependent proteolysis into a nonimmunological form (Lu ̈ thi et al., 2009). Therefore, full-length IL-33 released in necroptotic conditions (Kovalenko et al., 2009) (when caspases are not active) could be one of the necroptotic DAMPs (Figure 2C).

> Caspase activity is also thought to be responsible for modification of the immunogenic DAMP, HMGB1, into the nonimmunogenic oxidized HMGB1 form, and caspase-dependent condensation of chromatin traps HMBG1 during apoptosis (Kazama et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2008).

> mtDNA and possibly other mitochondrial proteins (Oka et al., 2012). On the other hand, damaged mitochondria are an important source of ROS that not only contribute to progression of cell death but can also modify the oxidative status of DAMPs. HMGB1 can illustrate this redox sensitivity (Figure 2C). This molecule can become proinflammatory in its reduced form (associated with necrosis) and immunologically silent in its oxidized form, which requires caspase activation and ROS production (Kazama et al., 2008).
