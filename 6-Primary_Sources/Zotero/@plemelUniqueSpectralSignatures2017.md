> Cellular injury and death are ubiquitous features of disease, yet tools to detect them are limited and insensitive to subtle pathological changes. Acridine orange (AO), a nucleic acid dye with unique spectral properties, enables real-time measurement of RNA and DNA as proxies for cell viability during exposure to various noxious stimuli. This tool illuminates spectral signatures unique to various modes of cell death, such as cells undergoing apoptosis versus necrosis/necroptosis. This new approach also shows that cellular RNA decreases during necrotic, necroptotic, and apoptotic cell death caused by demyelinating, ischemic, and traumatic injuries, implying its involvement in a wide spectrum of tissue pathologies. Furthermore, cells with pathologically low levels of cytoplasmic RNA are detected earlier and in higher numbers than with standard markers including TdT-mediated dUTP biotin nick-end labeling and cleaved caspase 3 immunofluorescence. Our technique highlights AO-labeled cytoplasmic RNA as an important early marker of cellular injury and a sensitive indicator of various modes of cell death in a range of experimental models.

> We hypothesized that the loss of RNA reflected metabolic decline; however, this proved not necessarily true: cellular ATP was not significantly reduced until 24 h after staurosporine treatment, whereas RNA differences were reduced by approximately half by 8 h (Fig. 4 o). With staurosporine treatment, RNA integrity—indicated by its RNA integrity number (RIN) score (Imbeaud et al., 2005)—remained high during periods of RNA loss (Fig. 4, q and r). In contrast, H2O2 treatment reduced cellular ATP levels 15 min after treatment; thus under these conditions, it could be in part responsible for the drop in RNA observed 2 h later (Fig. 4 p). Consistent with metabolic dysfunction driving RNA loss with H2O2 treatment, there was a drop in RNA integrity at 2 h that mirrored the overall loss of RNA (Fig. 4, s and t). Collectively, the apoptotic cell death initiated by staurosporine resulted in RNA loss without any measured drop in RNA quality or cellular energy levels, consistent with data suggesting active RNA degradation during apoptosis (Mondino and Jenkins, 1995; Del Prete et al., 2002; Bushell et al., 2004; Padmanabhan et al., 2012). The increase in necrotic cell death caused by H2O2 treatment resulted in an early metabolic decline, followed 2 h later by a drop in RNA integrity and RNA concentration, suggesting that metabolic decline might drive RNA loss during necrosis. 
  **Apoptosis cuts RNA on purpose.
Necrosis loses RNA because the cell’s internal systems fall apart.**

> To determine whether fibroblast cells undergoing different cell death mechanisms exhibit unique AO spectral patterns, cells were pulsed with staurosporine to induce apoptosis, H2O2 to induce necrosis, and TNF with caspase inhibition to induce necroptosis (Fig. 6). After 6 and 24 h, cells were fixed and stained with AO. Healthy cells in control conditions had a flattened morphology observable by cytoplasmic red AO emission; these cells had a clearly demarcated nucleus with enriched red signal lining the entirety of the nucleus (Fig. 6, i–k). After 6 h of staurosporine exposure, fibroblasts no longer possessed a flattened morphology but instead had thin processes with cellular fragmentation. As red AO signal diminished, cells lost remaining processes, no longer contained a clear nuclear demarcation, and had a shrunken nucleus. Late stages of apoptosis could be distinguished by the nearly complete absence of red AO signal and the fragmentation and condensation of nuclei that were easily distinguished by their irregular outline. In contrast to apoptosis, necrosis and necroptosis had several unique morphological attributes that were very similar to one another (Fig. 6, l–p). During early stages of necroptosis and necrosis, there was an overall loss of red AO structure caused by cellular shrinkage, but there were no signs of cellular fragmentation. These early signs of necrosis/necroptosis included nuclear shrinkage and a loss of nuclear demarcation. At the final stages of necrosis/necroptosis, the nuclei were small and spherical and often had an increase in intensity or a smooth ungranulated appearance. Such nuclei had little cytoplasmic red AO signal. Thus the lack of cytoplasmic and nuclear fragmentation—both observed with apoptosis—along with the persisting smooth round nucleus lacking cytoplasmic red AO emission was sufficient to distinguish necrosis/necroptosis from apoptosis. Because green AO emission reflects DNA changes and red AO emission is sensitive to RNA, we found that different mechanisms of cell death can be distinguished based on changes in the morphological distribution of these two different classifications of nucleotides. 
  **Healthy fibroblasts show strong cytoplasmic red AO signal and a clearly outlined nucleus.
Apoptotic cells lose their flattened shape, develop fragmented processes, and eventually show almost no red AO signal with condensed, irregular, fragmented nuclei.
Necrosis and necroptosis, in contrast, show early RNA loss without fragmentation and nuclei that become small, smooth, and perfectly round.
The absence of cytoplasmic and nuclear fragmentation is the key feature separating necrosis/necroptosis from apoptosis.
Overall, AO staining distinguishes death modes because red signal reflects RNA distribution and green signal reflects DNA organization.**

> This indicates that loss of cellular red AO emission—and hence RNA—decreased within cells as their cellular membrane became permeable. Indeed, almost all NR Dead+ cells (97%) lacked perinuclear red AO emission. The loss of cytoplasmic red AO signal preceded cell membrane permeability (Fig. 7 x), indicating that this feature is an early marker of cell injury/ death. Interestingly, the morphological features of AOlow perinuclear red cells was similar to necrosis/necroptosis in culture (Fig. 6), with a bright smooth nucleus having little to no perinuclear red AO emissions. Thus, this might represent a more general feature of necrosis useful for distinguishing cells undergoing this mechanism of cell death. Collectively, the loss of perinuclear RNA, readily detected by the AO spectral method, was an early pathological indication of injury in cells that preceded membrane permeability under ischemic conditions.

> Necrotic/necroptotic cells are characterized as those completely lacking cellular RNA but having a round, bright nucleus. In contrast, apoptotic cells also lose cytoplasmic RNA, but in vivo these cells had unique AO emissions: the nucleus contained either red or fragmented green emission.

> Because these AOlow perinuclear red cells are observed before cell membrane permeability, they might also be prenecrotic/necroptotic. However, based on data from our studies in culture and ex vivo, the presence of AOlow perinuclear red cells precedes cell membrane permeability by only a few hours to a day. Therefore, AOlow perinuclear red cells are likely cells with severe metabolic dysfunction that have lost cytoplasmic RNA and are in the process of undergoing necrosis/necroptosis.

> These AOlow perinuclear red cells are present in abundance after 2 wk of CPZ consumption, a time point that was chosen because it lacks overt myelin pathology. Animals on the CPZ diet contain apoptotic cells in the corpus callosum for 2–4 wk, with the peak of apoptosis occurring 3 wk after CPZ treatment (Matsushima and Morell, 2001). The amount of AOlow perinuclear red cells in our study exceeded apoptotic cells by almost 10-fold at a time when apoptosis is reported to begin, suggesting that necrosis/ necroptosis precedes and/or exceeds apoptosis in the post-CPZ period. Therefore, although apoptosis is the mode of cell death most commonly cited in this model, our data suggest that necrosis/necroptosis predominates. The causes of initial cell death in the CPZ model are unknown, but CPZ is thought to impair oligodendrocyte mitochondrial function and induce oxidative stress, which ultimately culminate in oligodendrocyte demise (Matsushima and Morell, 2001; Kipp et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2010). Our data here, collected based on AO emissions, would predict that oxidative stress in the CPZ model—much like H2O2 in cultured cells—drives necrotic cell death.

> had early loss of nuclear demarcation followed very quickly by a near-complete loss of red AO signal. Ultimately, both apoptotic and necrotic/necroptotic cells lost red AO signal. The most defining distinction between apoptosis and necrotic/necroptotic cells was that apoptotic cells lost red AO signal but at the same time had nuclear fragmentation. In contrast, necrotic/  necroptotic cells had a smooth and often bright nucleus while still lacking red AO signal.
