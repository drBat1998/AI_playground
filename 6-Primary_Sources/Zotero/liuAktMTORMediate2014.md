> Necroptosis is a newly described form of regulated necrosis that contributes to neuronal death in experimental models of stroke and brain trauma. Although much work has been done elucidating initiating mechanisms, signaling events governing necroptosis remain largely unexplored. Akt is known to inhibit apoptotic neuronal cell death. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a downstream effector of Akt that controls protein synthesis. We previously reported that dual inhibition of Akt and mTOR reduced acute cell death and improved long term cognitive deficits after controlled-cortical impact in mice. These findings raised the possibility that Akt/mTOR might regulate necroptosis. To test this hypothesis, we induced necroptosis in the hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22 using concomitant treatment with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and the pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone. TNFα/zVAD treatment induced cell death within 4 h. Cell death was preceded by RIPK1-RIPK3-pAkt assembly, and phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Thr473 of AKT and its direct substrate glycogen synthase kinase-3β, as well as mTOR and its direct substrate S6 ribosomal protein (S6), suggesting activation of Akt/mTOR pathways. Pretreatment with Akt inhibitor viii and rapamycin inhibited Akt and S6 phosphorylation events, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, and necroptosis by over 50% without affecting RIPK1-RIPK3 complex assembly. These data were confirmed using small inhibitory ribonucleic acid-mediated knockdown of AKT1/2 and mTOR. All of the aforementioned biochemical events were inhibited by necrostatin-1, including Akt and mTOR phosphorylation, generation of oxidative stress, and RIPK1-RIPK3-pAkt complex assembly. The data suggest a novel, heretofore unexpected role for Akt and mTOR downstream of RIPK1 activation in neuronal cell death.

> Akt/mTOR inhibition did not affect RIPK1–RIPK3 interaction but inhibited ROS production and cell death. Importantly, genetic inhibition of Akt and mTOR together reduced cell death by a magnitude similar to that of pharmacological inhibitors, confirming a specific role for Akt and mTOR. Taken together, the data indicate that Akt/mTOR mediate necroptosis signaling downstream of the necrosome assembly and before the production of ROS and onset of plasmalemma damage. The observation that concomitant inhibition of Akt and mTOR together was required for maximal protection is reminiscent of our findings in the CCI model, and suggests divergent roles for Akt and mTOR in necroptotic signaling in neuronal cells. In contrast, Akt activation was not involved in apoptosis of HT22 cells treated with TNF and CHX (Figure 4e).

> Prevailing wisdom assigns a prosurvival role for Akt in CNS injury paradigms including stroke and traumatic brain injury.29–40 Antiapoptotic activity of Akt has been well documented, through a number of mechanisms including inhibition of caspase 9, Bad, and GSK-3b, and induction of mitochondrial hexokinase and nuclear factor kappa B-dependent antiapoptotic gene expression.41–43 Nonetheless, several recent reports illustrate an emerging role for Akt as a ‘death kinase’ and a key regulator of programmed necrosis, including neuronal cell types,44 depending on injury context. Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt has been linked to cytotoxic cell death45–48 and nuclear translocation of Akt has been reported to sensitize cancer cells to death by chemotherapeutic agents.49,50 Akt inhibitors also protect cultured neurons against photodynamic induced necrosis.44 Data from the current study raise the question of which Akt/ mTOR substrates might be critical regulators of necroptosis in neuronal cells. Our data suggest a possible role for mTOR complex1-dependent regulation as previously reported by McNamara et al.,23 as well as the Akt substrates FOXO1, GSK-3b, and others. Although further studies are needed to determine the specific mediators downstream of Akt and mTOR, taken together the present data and our previous report11 suggest that Akt may promote necrosis in neuronal cell types following acute CNS injury.

> How might Akt promote necrotic death? Although limited activation of Akt is antiapoptotic, sustained Akt activity may promote cell death by a number of distinct mechanisms. Strong activation of Akt increases oxygen consumption by increasing glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in generation of ROS and oxidative stress.24,42 Sustained Akt activation also induces phosphorylation of forkhead box  subclass O (FOXO) transcription factors required for upregulation of antioxidant defenses such as manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase and sestrin-3.51,52 Phosphorylated FOXO transcription factors bind to 14-3-3 protein and are excluded from the nucleus, thus rendered transcriptionally inactive,53 and sustained phosphorylation promotes their proteosomal degradation.54,55 Our finding that the inhibition of Akt/mTOR strongly inhibited phosphorylation of FOXO1, reduced generation of ROS and inhibited death in HT22 cells stimulated to necroptosis suggests that Akt/mTOR activation may increase lethal oxidative stress after acute injury to neuronal cells. Finally, sustained Akt activation can constitutively activate cyclin-dependent kinase 2 leading to its cytoplasmic sequestration, cell cycle arrest at G2-M, and induction of cell death.56,57 Future studies aimed at pinpointing the exact mechanisms of Akt/mTOR-induced necroptosis are warranted as Akt and mTOR may not be optimal therapeutic targets for neuroprotection because of their protean functions in cells.

> Herein, we show that Akt and mTOR together account for B50% of the cell death in the conditions used in necroptosis assays. The other mechanism(s) that account for the remainder of necroptotic cell death remain to be discovered. A JNK inhibitor reduced necroptosis in HT22 cells by B50%; however, we did not observe an additive effect of Akt/mTOR/ JNK inhibitors and no effect of extracellular-regulated kinase or P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibition, consistent with a similar lack of a role for these MAPK in necroptosis of non-neuronal cell types.23,28 Interestingly, we previously reported that intracerebroventricular administration of necrostatin-1 reduced necrotic cell death in dentate gyrus and cortex after CCI in mice.3 However, these brain regions were not protected by Akt/mTOR inhibitors in our subsequent study,11 consistent with the findings of the current study that necrostatin-1 is fully and Akt/mTOR inhibitors only partially protective against necrotic cell death in HT22 cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time a role for Akt/mTOR signaling governing necroptosis in a neuronal cell line. The data are consistent with a need for dual inhibition of Akt and mTOR to reduce traumatic brain cell death in vivo.11 Elucidation of additional necroptosis signaling mechanisms downstream of necrosome assembly will be important to fully understand how necroptosis is regulated in neuronal cells. Such information is likely to yield new therapeutic targets to reduce cell death and improve functional outcome after stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other forms of acute CNS injury. A
