> In vivo resistance to first-line chemotherapy, including to glucocorticoids, is a strong predictor of poor outcome in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Modulation of cell death regulators represents an attractive strategy for subverting such drug resistance. Here we report complete resensitization of multidrug-resistant childhood ALL cells to glucocorticoids and other cytotoxic agents with subcytotoxic concentrations of obatoclax, a putative antagonist of BCL-2 family members. The reversal of glucocorticoid resistance occurred through rapid activation of autophagy-dependent necroptosis, which bypassed the block in mitochondrial apoptosis. This effect was associated with dissociation of the autophagy inducer beclin-1 from the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family member myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1) and with a marked decrease in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity. Consistent with a protective role for mTOR in glucocorticoid resistance in childhood ALL, combination of rapamycin with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone triggered autophagy-dependent cell death, with characteristic features of necroptosis. Execution of cell death, but not induction of autophagy, was strictly dependent on expression of receptor-interacting protein (RIP-1) kinase and cylindromatosis (turban tumor syndrome) (CYLD), two key regulators of necroptosis. Accordingly, both inhibition of RIP-1 and interference with CYLD restored glucocorticoid resistance completely. Together with evidence for a chemosensitizing activity of obatoclax in vivo, our data provide a compelling rationale for clinical translation of this pharmacological approach into treatments for patients with refractory ALL.

  **As I understood, the author showed that activation of autophagy in absence of apoptosis induces necroptosis.**

  **LC3-II IHC is a good way to check autophagy in cells.**

> Autophagy has been recognized as an important regulatory mechanism of cell fate decisions. While it is clear that autophagy can have a protective function at times of cellular stress, the contribution of autophagy to the execution of programmed cell death is a subject of controversy (13). Our data demonstrate that autophagic signalling is an integral part of the cell death mechanism when the response to dexamethasone is restored with obatoclax or rapamycin. Both inhibitors that interfere early (3-MA) or late (bafilomycin) with the autophagic process and knockdown of genes that are essential for autophagy, BECN1 and ATG7, prevented resensitization to dexamethasone completely. 
  **Autophagy is an integral part in some cell death.**
