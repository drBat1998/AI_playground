> Hepatic steatosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality after liver resection and transplantation. Although apoptosis is a key mechanism of reperfusion injury in the normal liver, the pathway leading to cell death in steatotic hepatocytes is unknown. A model of hepatic ischemia and reperfusion injury in fatty and lean Zucker rats was used. Fatty animals had increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) release and decreased survival after 60 minutes of ischemia compared with lean animals. Apoptosis was the predominant form of cell death in the lean rats (82%), whereas necrosis was minimal. In contrast, fatty animals developed only moderate amounts of apoptosis but showed massive necrosis (73%) after 24 hours of reperfusion. Intracellular mediators of apoptosis, such as caspase 8, caspase 3, and cytochrome c, were significantly lower in the steatotic than in the lean liver indicating dysfunction in activation of the apoptotic pathway. The high percentage of necrosis in the steatotic rats was associated with renal acute tubular necrosis after 24 hours of reperfusion in the fatty, but not in lean rats. Caspase inhibition significantly decreased reperfusion injury in lean animals, but was ineffective in fatty animals. The results indicate that the increased susceptibility of fatty livers to reperfusion injury is associated with a change from an apoptotic form of cell death to necrosis. We conclude that new therapeutic strategies are necessary in the fatty liver.

> Reperfusion in normal livers resulted in rapid activation of the apoptotic cascade evidenced by activation of caspase 8, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activation of caspase 3. In contrast, in fatty livers each tested mediator of apoptosis was significantly decreased compared with the lean indicating a dysfunction in the apoptotic pathway

> The failure of apoptosis in the fatty liver could be linked to decreased adenosine triphosphate production in fatty hepatocytes. Steatosis is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased intracellular energy levels.3,4,28 Apoptosis is an active, energy-requiring process, and low adenosine triphosphate levels could result in a failure to activate the apoptotic cascade. A second possibility is a dysfunction of regulators of apoptosis in fatty hepatocytes. 
  **Apoptosis is extremly energy demanded process.**
