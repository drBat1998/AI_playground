> Regulated necrosis or necroptosis, mediated by receptor-interacting kinase 1 (RIPK1), RIPK3 and pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory, infectious and degenerative diseases. Recently identified necroptosis inhibitors display moderate specificity, suboptimal pharmacokinetics, off-target effects and toxicity, preventing these molecules from reaching the clinic. Here, we developed a cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) cascade for the identification of small-molecule inhibitors of necroptosis. From the initial library of over 250,000 compounds, the primary screening phase identified 356 compounds that strongly inhibited TNF-α-induced necroptosis, but not apoptosis, in human and murine cell systems, with EC50 < 6.7 μM. From these, 251 compounds were tested for RIPK1 and/or RIPK3 kinase inhibitory activity; some were active and several have novel mechanisms of action. Based on specific chemical descriptors, 110 compounds proceeded into the secondary screening cascade, which then identified seven compounds with maximum ability to reduce MLKL activation, IC50 >100 μM, EC50 2.5-11.5 μM under long-term necroptosis execution in murine fibroblast L929 cells, and full protection from ATP depletion and membrane leakage in human and murine cells. As a proof of concept, compound SN-6109, with binding mode to RIPK1 similar to that of necrostatin-1, confirmed RIPK1 inhibitory activity and appropriate pharmacokinetic properties. SN-6109 was further tested in mice, showing efficacy against TNF-α-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In conclusion, a phenotypic-driven HTS cascade promptly identified robust necroptosis inhibitors with in vivo activity, currently undergoing further medicinal chemistry optimization. Notably, the novel hits highlight the opportunity to identify new molecular mechanisms of action in necroptosis.

> Upon interaction with TNF-α, TNFR1 trimerizes and assembles with TRADD, RIPK1, CYLD, TRAF2 and cIAP 1/2, thus forming the membrane-associated protein complex I.
