> To maintain cellular homeostasis, cells are equipped with precise systems that trigger the appropriate stress responses. Mitochondria not only provide cellular energy but also integrate stress response signaling pathways, including those regulating cell death. Several lines of evidence suggest that the mitochondrial proteins that function in this process, such as Bcl-2 family proteins in apoptosis and phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM5) in necroptosis, are regulated by several kinases. It has also been suggested that the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of mitochondrial fission machinery, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), facilitates appropriate cellular stress responses. However, mitochondria themselves are also damaged by various stresses. To avoid the deleterious effects exerted by damaged mitochondria, cells remove these mitochondria in a selective autophagic degradation process called mitophagy. Interestingly, several kinases, such as PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) in mammals and stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in yeast, have recently been shown to be involved in mitophagy. In this paper, we focus on the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of mitochondrial proteins and discuss the roles of this regulation in the mitochondrial and cellular stress responses.

  **Mitochondria dynamically fused and divided to save as many functional organelles as possible. If one mitochondrion is mildly damaged, fusion with a healthy one could maintain its functionality.**

  **Mitochondrial elongation,  due to their fusion, is reported to be an effective intracellular strategy to overcome stress.**

  **PGAM5 is a ser/thr protein phosphatase. phosphatase activity of PGAM5 is required for the activation of stress-responsive MAP kinase pathways**

  **RIPK3 phosphorylates PGAM5. phosphorylation of PGAM5 increases its activity and activates Drp2 by dephosphorylation. This leads to fission.**
