> Mutations in MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau) cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD). MAPT mutations are associated with abnormal tau phosphorylation levels and accumulation of misfolded tau protein that can propagate between neurons ultimately leading to cell death (tauopathy). Recently, a p.A152T tau variant was identified as a risk factor for FTD, Alzheimer's disease, and synucleinopathies. Here we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from a patient carrying this p.A152T variant to create a robust, functional cellular assay system for probing pathophysiological tau accumulation and phosphorylation. Using stably transduced iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells engineered to enable inducible expression of the pro-neural transcription factor Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2), we generated disease-relevant, cortical-like glutamatergic neurons in a scalable, high-throughput screening compatible format. Utilizing automated confocal microscopy, and an advanced image-processing pipeline optimized for analysis of morphologically complex human neuronal cultures, we report quantitative, subcellular localization-specific effects of multiple kinase inhibitors on tau, including ones under clinical investigation not previously reported to affect tau phosphorylation. These results demonstrate the potential for using patient iPSC-derived ex vivo models of tauopathy as genetically accurate, disease-relevant systems to probe tau biochemistry and support the discovery of novel therapeutics for tauopathies.

 High‐content image analysis. Automated image acquisition of iNgn2 neurons in 96-well plates immunostained with PHF-1/K9JA/βIII-tubulin/Hoechst 33342 was performed by acquiring 25 fields evenly spaced over each well and at identical positions across all wells. Segmentation and quantification of the resulting images was performed using the Developer Toolbox of the IN Cell Analyzer 6000 system. Raw measures were derived from neuronal cell bodies and the neurite fields independently. A combination of Hoechst nuclear stain intensity and shape criteria, along with contiguous βIII-tubulin and K9JA signals were used to classify appropriately shaped objects as neuronal cell bodies. Neurites were identified and segmented using a combination of βIIItubulin, K9JA, and PHF-1 signals. Once the cell body mask and the total cell mask (all neurites and all cell bodies) had been obtained, we employed ‘image math subtraction’ (similar to the correspondingly named ImageJ process) to remove cell body areas from the final neurite masks for quantification. Segmentation of images was performed within the proprietary Developer Toolbox software of the IN Cell Analyzer 6000. Given the inherent complexity of the neuronal morphology in our images, we found that an edge detection-based method worked better than intensity thresholding to create the initial cell body and neurite masks. Final criteria for inclusion/ exclusion of objects were based on mean intensity of the entire object (for example the nuclei, which had substantially higher mean intensity in clumped, dead cells) rather than overall thresholding. Clumped, dead nuclei were identified and excluded from analysis during the segmentation process by a combination of size (dead nuclei are significantly smaller), Hoechst intensity (dead nuclei are significantly brighter), and morphological (dead nuclei usually have rugged shape rather than being oval or round with smooth circumference) parameters. We utilized 10 iterations to create the total neurite mask before fine tuning to remove cell body areas, clumped areas, and background. Images had to pass a number of quality control checkpoints: (a) Experimental 96-well plates were considered ‘unresponsive’ and thus excluded if PHF-1 raw intensity ratio for DMSO/CHIR-99021 (11 μM)< 1.3 based on extensive data collection over 3 years. (b) Individual images in each well with a neurite area smaller than the lower 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were excluded; (c) images with a neurite area smaller than the lower 95% Confidence Interval of the DMSO-treated wells were excluded. Mean PHF-1 intensity was calculated by taking the total PHF-1 intensity in an image field divided by the total neurite area of the same image. The mean PHF-1 intensity resulting from a compound treatment (fold change versus DMSO) was calculated by taking the mean PHF-1 intensity value in an image field divided by the average of the mean PHF-1 intensity of DMSO treatment of the entire well. PHF-1/K9JA ratio was calculated by dividing the mean PHF-1 intensity over the mean K9JA intensity for each image field. For enzastaurin and ruboxistaurin compound treatments, each dose of each compound was added to duplicate wells, and four DMSO wells were included in each plate. For the compound library and compound hits treatments, each dose of each compound was added to a single well per plate, with two replicate 96-well plates per culture. Dose–response data from the compound hits treatment were analysed by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism and curve fitting was performed by plotting log (agonist) vs. response (variable slope) to determine the IC50 values of the compounds. Z-factors  were calculated using Eq. (4) in Zhang et al.76 with 19 negative control (DMSO or vehicle-treated) wells and 20 positive control (11 μM CHIR-99021) wells for the control iNgn2 neurons and 20 wells for both negative and positive control wells for the Tau-A152T neurons.
