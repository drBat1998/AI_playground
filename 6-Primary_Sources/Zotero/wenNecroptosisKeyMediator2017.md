> Cell death is an important biological process that is believed to have a central role in intestinal ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. While the apoptosis  inhibition is pivotal in preventing intestinal I/R, how necrotic cell death is  regulated remains unknown. Necroptosis represents a newly discovered form of  programmed cell death that combines the features of both apoptosis and necrosis,  and it has been implicated in the development of a range of inflammatory  diseases. Here, we show that receptor-interacting protein 1/3 (RIP1/3) kinase and  mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein recruitment mediates necroptosis in a  rat model of ischaemic intestinal injury in vivo. Furthermore, necroptosis was  specifically blocked by the RIP1 kinase inhibitor necrostatin-1. In addition, the  combined treatment of necrostatin-1 and the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD acted  synergistically to protect against intestinal I/R injury, and these two pathways  can be converted to one another when one is inhibited. In vitro, necrostatin-1  pre-treatment reduced the necroptotic death of oxygen-glucose deprivation  challenged intestinal epithelial cell-6 cells, which in turn dampened the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-α and  interleukin-1β), and suppressed high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) translocation  from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and the subsequent release of HMGB1 into the  supernatant, thus decreasing the activation of Toll-like receptor 4 and the  receptor for advanced glycation end products. Collectively, our study reveals a  robust RIP1/RIP3-dependent necroptosis pathway in intestinal I/R-induced  intestinal injury in vivo and in vitro and suggests that the HMGB1 signalling is  highly involved in this process, making it a novel therapeutic target for acute  ischaemic intestinal injury.

> In this study, our findings provide evidence that necroptosis is of important functional relevance to intestinal I/R injury in vivo and in OGD-challenged IEC-6 injury in vitro. Simultaneous blockade of necroptosis and apoptosis using Nec-1 and Z-VAD conferred enhanced intestinal protection, and the underlying mechanisms seem to be attributable to the inhibition of RIP1/RIP3/MLKL complex formation and subsequent HMGB1 signalling.
