> As the global population ages, the incidence of elderly patients with dementia, represented by Alzheimer's disease (AD), will continue to increase. Previous studies have suggested that β-amyloid protein (Aβ) deposition is a key factor leading to AD. However, the clinical efficacy of treating AD with anti-Aβ protein antibodies is not satisfactory, suggesting that Aβ amyloidosis may be a pathological change rather than a key factor leading to AD. Identification of the causes of AD and development of corresponding prevention and treatment strategies is an important goal of current research. Following the discovery of soluble oligomeric forms of Aβ (AβO) in 1998, scientists began to focus on the neurotoxicity of AβOs. As an endogenous neurotoxin, the active growth of AβOs can lead to neuronal death, which is believed to occur before plaque formation, suggesting that AβOs are the key factors leading to AD. PANoptosis, a newly proposed concept of cell death that includes known modes of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, is a form of cell death regulated by the PANoptosome complex. Neuronal survival depends on proper mitochondrial function. Under conditions of AβO interference, mitochondrial dysfunction occurs, releasing lethal contents as potential upstream effectors of the PANoptosome. Considering the critical role of neurons in cognitive function and the development of AD as well as the regulatory role of mitochondrial function in neuronal survival, investigation of the potential mechanisms leading to neuronal PANoptosis is crucial. This review describes the disruption of neuronal mitochondrial function by AβOs and elucidates how AβOs may activate neuronal PANoptosis by causing mitochondrial dysfunction during the development of AD, providing guidance for the development of targeted neuronal treatment strategies.

> Soluble Aβ oligomers (AβO) are believed to be more harmful than Aβ fibrils and plaques and are considered the main causes of various toxic effects, such as decreased cognitive ability and neuronal death, in brains affected by AD (Lambert et al., 1998; Cline et al., 2018).

> Compared to Aβ monomers, AβOs have a greater affinity for biological membrane lipid bilayers. Not only do AβOs directly  insert into lipid bilayers, altering neuronal cell membrane structure and causing the formation of membrane pores; they are also internalized into neurons via endocytic vesicles, accelerating their aggregation in the lysosomal acidic environment.

> Increasing evidence suggests that AβOs impair mitochondrial function by disrupting mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial cristae structure, decreasing mitochondrial quantity and quality, causing defects in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and inhibiting the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC; Baloyannis, 2006; Krishnan et al., 2012; Mckenna et al., 2016; Arrázola et al., 2017; Sorrentino et al., 2017; Perez Ortiz and Swerdlow, 2019).

> Aβ fragments initially leads to the spontaneous aggregation of Aβ monomers into soluble Aβ oligomers, followed by aggregation of the oligomers to form insoluble protofibrils (Hayden and Teplow, 2013).

> The appearance of Aβ plaques in the brain, known as senile plaques, is a major hallmark of AD (Walker, 2020). Despite the fact that Aβ plaques are considered pathological markers of AD, soluble AβOs, especially oligomers formed by 2–50 monomers, are believed to be the main causes of the various neurotoxic effects that lead to cognitive decline in the AD brain.

> Recently, a 20-year multicenter nested case-control study revealed that as cognitive function declines, the rate of change in Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients initially accelerates significantly (Jia et al., 2024). However, with time, the rate of change slows, suggesting that in the late stages of AD, Aβ aggregates into large protofibrils and that its toxic mechanisms are complete. The accumulating evidence to date supports the following statements: (1) monomeric Aβ has important biological functions at physiological concentrations (Kumar et al., 2016; Brothers et al., 2018); (2) in the elderly population, there is a large accumulation of Aβ plaques in the brain in the absence of severe cognitive impairment, while AD patients, despite having a small amount of Aβ aggregation, exhibit more severe dementia symptoms (Tomiyama et al., 2008; Shimada et al., 2011); and (3) the plasma AβO concentration shows good accuracy as a marker in screening for AD (Lue et al., 1999; Mclean et al., 1999; Näslund et al., 2000; Steinerman et al., 2008; Lesné et al., 2013).

> Eliminating the APP gene has adverse consequences in both animal models and humans. In rodents, knocking out APP does not affect survival, but it disrupts brain development and neurogenesis (Wang et al., 2016).

> Furthermore, the plaque burden in the AD brain correlates poorly with disease status and does not reflect clinical phenotype well (Arnold et al., 1991; Braak and Braak, 1991; Nagy et al., 1999).

> The Osaka mutation of APP (E693 deletion) leads to the accumulation of AβO and AD pathology without the formation of senile plaques (Tomiyama et al., 2008; Nishitsuji et al., 2009; Shimada et al., 2011; Jang et al., 2013).

> Importantly, AβO-selective antibodies can prevent AD-like pathology in mice and ameliorates cognitive deficits in AD mice for at least 40 days (Xiao et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2014; Sebollela et al., 2017; Cline et al., 2018; Viola et al., 2021). The above evidence indicates that AβOs are not only necessary but also sufficient triggers for ADrelated neurodegeneration.

> In addition to directly damaging the cell membrane, AβOs also bind to membrane-specific receptors, triggering downstream signaling pathways. The potential receptors for AβOs are reviewed in detail by Jarosz-Griffiths et al. (2016). This phenomenon explains why treating cell surfaces with low doses of trypsin almost eliminates AβO binding (Lambert et al., 1998). Accumulating reports have identified many AβO receptors and binding proteins; well-studied AβO receptors include the cellular prion protein (PrPc), which depends on the integrity of cholesterolrich lipid rafts (Kostylev et al., 2015), and the neuronspecific NaK ATPase α3 subunit (NKAα3), which can lead to neurodegeneration through presynaptic calcium overload (Ohnishi et al., 2015).

> In addition, several receptors have been reported to bind to AβOs, allowing AβOs to enter neurons in an endocytic form (Table 1). Aβ accumulates in lysosomal vesicles, which have low internal pH. The rate of assembly of AβOs increases by 8,000fold when they move from the neutral extracellular environment to the low-pH environment within lysosomes (Schützmann et al., 2021). The acidic environment within endosomes and lysosomes serves as a preferential site for AβO formation (Lee et al., 2022). Aβ-producing sites, such as mitochondria, are also found inside cells (Anandatheerthavarada et al., 2003; Vaillant-Beuchot et al., 2021). A comparison of the damage caused by endocytosis or other transport of Aβ to the direct damage caused by Aβ synthesis within organelles indicates that the latter causes greater damage.

> Aβ42, which is prone to oligomerization, has greater spreading and transfer capability than other Aβ subtypes, and this is partly attributable to the endosomal transport system (Ono et al., 2012).

> β and its oligomers have been reported to participate in mitochondrial dysfunction through various mechanisms (Peng et al., 2020). These mechanisms include disruption of mitochondrial morphology (e.g., through damage to mitochondrial cristae), interference with normal electron transport chain processes, induction of oxidative stress, and impairment of mitochondrial dynamics, resulting in disruption of the normal processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion.

> Like most pore-forming toxins, AβO can induce perforation of neuronal and mitochondrial membranes; this is considered a mechanism of neurotoxicity induction and is observed in human AD patients (Lin et al., 2001; Lashuel et al., 2002, 2003; Inoue, 2008; Tong et al., 2018). Oligomeric forms of Aβ facilitate opening of the mPTP, which results in activation of a mitochondria-dependent cascade of neuronal cell death (Arrázola et al., 2017).

> ROS mainly appear as chemical substances that are active in the aerobic metabolic processes of cells. Metal ions can bind to Aβ and participate in the production of ROS originating from non-mitochondrial sources; for details on this process, one can refer to the excellent review by Cheignon et al. (2018). ROS are gradually released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm, passing through the OMM in a process that requires mediation by VDAC (Brdiczka et al., 2006). VDAC colocalizes with APP and AβO in the frontal cortex of AD patients, confirming its relevance to AD progression (Manczak and Reddy, 2012). The mitochondrial double-membrane pore has two oxidation-sensitive sites. One of these sites has a pyridine nucleotide-binding motif that can bind to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH); the other site has a glutathione-binding motif that can bind to glutathione (Bernardi et al., 2023). ROS can oxidize NADH, NADPH, and glutathione bound to mitochondrial double-membrane pores and thereby promote the opening of these membrane pores. Treatment with antioxidants can help cells restore the appropriate ROS balance and reduce the damage caused by AβO to the mitochondrial double membrane; such treatment shows promising therapeutic effects in patients with MCI and in animal models of AD (Peng et al., 2020; Sousa et al., 2023).

> ZBP1 is upregulated in the brain tissue of AD rats and in AD neurons (Guo et al., 2023a). Silencing ZBP1 significantly reduces cell damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation in AD neurons and improves cognitive function in AD model rats (Guo et al., 2023a). ZBP1 can also be activated by mtDNA, and this activation induces the release of proinflammatory markers from microglia (Saada et al., 2022). Neuroinflammation is associated with neuronal necroptosis (Jayaraman et al., 2021). RIPK1 is a key mediator of neuronal death and inflammation and a critical target for treating AD (Yuan et al., 2019; Hugon and Paquet, 2021; Vissers et al., 2022). Phosphorylated MLKL is coexpressed with RIPK1 in CA1 pyramidal neurons of AD patients (Jayaraman et al., 2021). Neuron-specific RIPK1- or RIPK3-deficient mice exhibit significant protection against chronic traumatic brain injury and experience reduced neuronal apoptosis (Wehn et al., 2021). AIM2 can assemble into an inflammatory complex, leading to neuronal dysfunction and ultimately neurodegeneration (Hornung et al., 2009). AIM2 can also increase Aβ deposition, but it has little impact on memory function in 5xFAD mice (Wu et al., 2017). AβOs can activate AIM2 inflammasomes, leading to accumulation of the RIPK1 protein and disruption of mitochondrial autophagy (Cao et al., 2021). Furthermore, defective AIM2 inflammasome signaling leads to decreased neuronal death, but it responds to DNA damageinducing agents and neuronal development processes (Lammert et al., 2020). Moreover, inhibition of TAK1 can reduce ischemiainduced neuronal apoptosis (Neubert et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2020).

> Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) activated by the cGAS-STING signaling pathway binds to TNF receptors (TNFRs) on the cell surface, transmitting death signals through RIPK1 and RIPK3 and forming the RIPK1RIPK3-MLKL necrosome. STING agonists can also activate STING-dependent PANoptosis (Messaoud-Nacer et al., 2022).

> Since mtDNA is located close to the ETC complexes on the inner membrane and lacks histone protection, mtDNA is the primary target of ROS attack, resulting in oxidative damage to mtDNA. In AD, oxidative damage to mtDNA directly inhibits the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins, affecting their proper expression, reducing the number of mitochondria, disrupting intracellular energy metabolism, and causing abnormal apoptosis of neurons. Additionally, oxidative damage-mediated 8-hydroxyguanine and formamidopyrimidine modifications lead to G:C→ T:A transversion mutations in mtDNA, resulting in the formation of a mutated form of mtDNA that assumes a ZDNA conformation (Yasui et al., 2014). The Z-DNA structure is characterized by a left-handed helix and a highly twisted structure, causing it to present a zigzag appearance (Herbert, 2019). ZBP1, a PANoptosome complex, can specifically recognize and bind to Z-DNA, thereby activating cell-programmed necrosis and pyroptosis pathways dependent on the RIPK3-MLKL and ZBP1NLRP3 pathways (Ravichandran et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020; Zheng and Kanneganti, 2020; Zhang et al., 2022; Nassour et al., 2023).
