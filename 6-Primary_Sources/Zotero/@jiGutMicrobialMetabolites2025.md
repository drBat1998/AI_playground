> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognised as a disorder that extends beyond the brain, with accumulating evidence implicating gut microbiota-derived metabolites in its onset and progression. This narrative review synthesises 92 peer-reviewed animal, human and meta-analytic studies published between 2010 and 2025 that investigated short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), tryptophan-derived indoles and kynurenines, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and secondary bile acids in the context of AD. Collectively, the literature shows that SCFAs support blood-brain-barrier integrity, dampen microglial reactivity and enhance synaptic plasticity, yet can paradoxically amplify β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition under germ-free or supraphysiological conditions, highlighting the importance of host status and dosing. Beneficial indole metabolites such as indole-3-propionic acid counter oxidative stress, strengthen intestinal and cerebral barriers and suppress pro-inflammatory cascades, whereas a shift toward neurotoxic kynurenines correlates with cognitive decline. TMAO emerges as a consistently deleterious metabolite that aggravates endothelial dysfunction, neuroinflammation and Aβ aggregation; dietary precursor restriction and microbial enzyme inhibitors are therefore being explored as mitigation strategies. Secondary bile acids and polyphenol derivatives further modulate mitochondrial bioenergetics and NF-κB signalling, broadening the therapeutic landscape. Multi-omics profiling reveals that AD patients typically exhibit reduced SCFAs and indoles but elevated TMAO, changes that scale with Mini-Mental State Examination scores, brain atrophy and cerebrospinal Aβ₄₂ levels. Early probiotic and faecal-microbiota-transplant trials have begun to normalise these metabolite profiles and yield modest cognitive benefits, underscoring translational potential. Altogether, gut-derived metabolites are not passive by-products but active modulators of neural, immune and metabolic circuits along the microbiota-gut-brain axis; their targeted manipulation and standardised metabolomic assessment could enable earlier diagnosis and precision microbiome-based interventions for AD, a promise that now warrants validation in large, longitudinal and mechanistically informed clinical studies.

  **AD is chronic, progressive neurodegenratice disorderd that primarily affecte memory and eventually leads to global demetia. The two key hallmarker of the lesion are b-amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein neurofibillary tangles. In addition, pathogenesis of the disease consist of neuronal loss, reduced synaptic density, microglial and astrocyte activation. The disease ussually starts form the medial temoral lobe.**

> SCFAs serve as essential energy sources for colonocytes and  regulate host immune responses, inflammatory signaling, and neurotransmitter synthesis by  activating G protein-coupled receptors (e.g., GPR41, GPR43) or inhibiting histone  deacetylases (HDACs) (21, 24).

  **Gut bacteria convert tryptophan into indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), and  indolelactic acid (ILA).

These metabolites can activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and  pregnane X receptor (PXR), thereby regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and intestinal  epithelial barrier function (23, 25). Some indole derivatives can cross the blood–brain barrier  (BBB) and influence neuronal excitability and glial cell activation, indicating their key role in  modulating brain function (23, 26).**

> TMAO is derived from the microbial metabolism of dietary choline, L-carnitine, and  porphyrin compounds. Its precursor, trimethylamine (TMA), is oxidized to TMAO by hepatic  flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). Elevated TMAO levels have been positively  associated with various chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, renal dysfunction,

> In addition to these core metabolites, the gut microbiota can transform  dietary polyphenols into metabolites with enhanced bioactivity, such as protocatechuic acid  and phenylpropanoid derivatives.

> Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut  microbiota affects the CNS via several interconnected pathways, including neural, endocrine,  immune, metabolic, and barrier-associated mechanisms.

> The gut is one of the largest endocrine organs and houses numerous enteroendocrine cells  (EECs), which secrete hormones in response to microbial metabolites. SCFAs can activate  GPR41 and GPR43 receptors on EECs, stimulating the release of glucagon-like peptide-1  (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), thereby modulating appetite, glucose metabolism, and  neuroprotection (33-35)

> The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in the development and function of the host immune  system. It regulates the differentiation of dendritic cells, macrophages, and regulatory T cells  (Tregs), thereby influencing both local and systemic immune responses. SCFAs—particularly  butyrate—promote Treg differentiation, inhibit pro-inflammatory Th17 cell activity, and  reduce the production of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α (

> Microbial metabolites—including SCFAs, tryptophan-derived compounds, secondary bile  acids, TMAO, and polyphenol derivatives—serve as important mediators of host–microbiota  interactions. Some small metabolites (e.g., acetate, propionate) can cross the BBB via  systemic circulation, directly influencing neuronal excitability and synaptic function (42). A
