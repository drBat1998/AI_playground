> Background: The regulation of divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) by insulin has been previously described in Langerhans cells and significant neuroprotection was found by insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 treatment during experimental cerebral ischemia in acute ischemic stroke patients and in a rat 6-OHDA model of Parkinson's disease, where DMT1 involvement is described. According to the regulation of DMT1, previously described as a target gene of NF-kB in the early phase of post-ischemic neurodegeneration, both in vitro and in vivo, and because insulin controls the NFkB signaling with protection from ischemic cell death in rat cardiomyocytes, we evaluated the role of insulin in relation to DMT1 expression and function during ischemic neurodegeneration. Methods: Insulin neuroprotection is evaluated in differentiated human neuroblastoma cells, SK-N-SH, and in primary mouse cortical neurons exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) for 8 h or 3 h, respectively, with or without 300 nM insulin. The insulin neuroprotection during OGD was evaluated in both cellular models in terms of cell death, and in SK-N-SH for DMT1 protein expression and acute ferrous iron treatment, performed in acidic conditions, known to promote the maximum DMT1 uptake as a proton co-transporter; and the transactivation of 1B/DMT1 mouse promoter, already known to be responsive to NF-kB, was analyzed in primary mouse cortical neurons. Results: Insulin neuroprotection during OGD was concomitant to the down-regulation of both DMT1 protein expression and 1B/DMT1 mouse promoter transactivation. We also showed the insulin-dependent protection from cell death after acute ferrous iron treatment. In conclusion, although preliminary, this evaluation highlights the peculiar role of DMT1 as a possible pharmacological target, involved in neuroprotection by insulin during in vitro neuronal ischemia and acute ferrous iron uptake.

> SK-N-SHcell culture. The human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and differentiated into a neuronal-like phenotype by treatment with 50 μM retinoic acid (Sigma Aldrich, Milano, Italy) for 10–12 days, a condition known to induce mitotic arrest [28].

> n vitro ischemia.Oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) was performed as previously described [24]. Primary mouse cortical neurons at 10 DIV were subjected to OGD for 3 h, with or without 300 nM insulin (Sigma Aldrich, Milano, Italy, with 30 min pre-treatment with OGD. After OGD exposure in primary neurons, cellular lysis was followed by cell death evaluation, measuring the total LDH, the LDH release, and cellular content (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). SK-N-SH human neuronal cells, more resistant than cortical neurons to anoxia and noxious treatments like ferrous iron, were exposed to OGD for 8 h, with or without 300 nM insulin (Sigma Aldrich, Milano, Italy), with 30 min pre-treatment to OGD, and further analyzed for cell death by measuring the total LDH, the LDH released, and the cellular content (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
