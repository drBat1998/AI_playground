> The exclusion of charged fluorescent dyes by intact cells has become a well-established assay for determining viability of cells. In search for a noninvasive fluorescent probe capable of long-term monitoring of cell death in real-time, we evaluated a new anthracycline derivative DRAQ7. The novel probe does not penetrate the plasma membrane of living cells but when the membrane integrity is compromised, it enters and binds readily to nuclear DNA to report cell death. It proved to be nontoxic to a panel of cancer cell lines grown continuously for up to 72 h and did not induce any detectable DNA damage signaling when analyzed using laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. The DRAQ7 provided a sensitive, real-time readout of cell death induced by a variety of stressors such as hypoxia, starvation, and drug-induced cytotoxicity. The overall responses to anticancer agents and resulting pharmacological dose-response profiles were not affected by the growth of tumor cells in the presence DRAQ7. Moreover, we for the first time introduced a near real-time microflow cytometric assay based on combination of DRAQ7 and mitochondrial inner membrane potential (ΔΨ(m) ) sensitive probe TMRM. We provide evidence that this low-dosage, real-time labeling procedure provides multiparameter and kinetic fingerprint of anticancer drug action.

> DRAQ7 Does Not Cause Detectable Cytotoxicity (Acute or Long-Term)  Initial screening of U937 and THP1a cell lines with a dose range of 0.35–10 lM DRAQ7 was undertaken to assess the impact of the probe on cell viability. When analyzed using microflow cytometer, all cells continuously grown in the presence of a DRAQ7, did not show any increase in basal fluorescence after 24 h of exposure (Fig. 1A, upper panel). This feature suggested that DRAQ7 as a viability probe could be particularly suitable for kinetic assays. It was also in contrast to our previously reported data on the spectrally dissimilar plasma membrane permeability marker propidium iodide (PI; 1 lg/ml; excitation at 488 nm, emission at 585 nm) where continuous culture of cells with PI led to a profound increase in overall cell fluorescence, despite having no impact on cell viability (6). Most notably, the fluorescence levels of cells cultured with DRAQ7 were comparable to end-point staining with 1 lg/ml of PI (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Both U937 and THP1a cells remained viable when grown with the DRAQ7 probe as evidenced by the lack of cell subpopulations exhibiting enhanced fluorescence signal intensity in the top right quadrants (Fig. 1A). Importantly, even a 20 lM concentration of DRAQ7 proved to be nontoxic to both cell lines for up to 72 h, also confirmed by the counterstaining with PI (Figs. 1B1C). Moreover, no dysfunctions in the mitochondrial function were observed as assessed by the multiparameter labeling with DCm sensitive probe tertamethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM; 200 nM) at 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation (Fig. 1D). Most cells featured intact and energized mitochondria indicated by TMRMhigh and DRAQ7neg (deemed live) subpopulation in the upper left quadrant shown in Figure 1D. Cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution were also not affected for up to 72 h growth of cells in the presence of 3–5 lM DRAQ7 (data not shown).

> These promising results prompted us to expand our bioassay development approach to incorporate a two-color real-time assay utilizing both the DRAQ7 and a DCm sensitive probe TMRM (Fig. 4C) (1,24). The latter probe is inert to many human cell lines at concentrations not exceeding 500 nM when grown in continuous presence of the probe for up to 72 h. This offers a unique capability to perform real-time monitoring of mitochondrial membrane inner membrane potential without any additional staining and washing steps. Accordingly, we have combined both probes to provide a multiparameter readout of caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by small-molecule drugs. On treatment with the apoptosis inducer AD, the real-time DRAQ7/TMRM assay provided similar estimates of the three cell populations: TMRMhigh/ DRAQ7neg (deemed live), TMRMlow/DRAQ7neg (deemed early apoptotic), and TMRMlow/DRAQ7high (deemed late apoptotic/necrotic) as the data obtained using conventional end-point protocols (Fig. 4C; Pearson linear correlation R2 5 0.98–0.99).
