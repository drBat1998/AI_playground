> The mechanism of apoptosis has been extensively characterized over the past decade, but little is known about alternative forms of regulated cell death. Although stimulation of the Fas/TNFR receptor family triggers a canonical 'extrinsic' apoptosis pathway, we demonstrated that in the absence of intracellular apoptotic signaling it is capable of activating a common nonapoptotic death pathway, which we term necroptosis. We showed that necroptosis is characterized by necrotic cell death morphology and activation of autophagy. We identified a specific and potent small-molecule inhibitor of necroptosis, necrostatin-1, which blocks a critical step in necroptosis. We demonstrated that necroptosis contributes to delayed mouse ischemic brain injury in vivo through a mechanism distinct from that of apoptosis and offers a new therapeutic target for stroke with an extended window for neuroprotection. Our study identifies a previously undescribed basic cell-death pathway with potentially broad relevance to human pathologies.

> Paradoxically, however, a growing number of studies has reported that caspase inhibition does not prevent DR-induced cell death. Furthermore, cell death induced under such conditions lacks the typical features of apoptosis and instead resembles necrosis3–6.

> The similar necrotic morphological features shown by multiple cell types when undergoing DR-induced cell death without caspase activation suggest the presence of a shared, alternative, nonapoptotic cell-death pathway.

> From these results, we concluded that oxidative stress, although important in some systems, does not play a universal role in necroptotic signaling and that Nec-1 does not act as antioxidant in inhibiting necroptosis.

> However, necroptosis proceeded normally in the presence of 3-methyladenine (3MA), an inhibitor of autophagy (Fig. 4e and data not shown), in autophagy-deficient Atg5 / MEF cells22 (Fig. 4f) and in cells where the critical autophagic factor beclin-1 (ref. 23) was knocked down by RNAi (Fig. 4g,h).

> autophagy as a common downstream consequence of necroptosis, rather than a contributing factor to necroptotic cell death.

> Furthermore, Nec-1 blocks necroptosis but not rapamycin-induced autophagy (Fig. 4d), which indicates that the two processes are independently regulated.
