> Based on OR logic gate, we proposed a smart near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe, named VPCPP, for simultaneously monitoring local microviscosity, micropolarity, and carboxylesterases (CEs) in living cells through blue and red channels. This proposed probe was capable of distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells and had good potential for identifying living liver cell lines. Furthermore, the fluctuations of the three analytes of interest in different cell status was successfully explored. Particularly, facilitated with high-content analysis (HCA) and VPCPP, a simple and efficient high-throughput screening (HTS) platform was first constructed for screening antitumor drugs and studying their effect on the analytes. For the first time, we found that sorafenib-induced ferroptosis led to an increase in the microviscosity and up-regulation of CEs at the same time. Additionally, the procedure that aristolochic acid (AA) induced the overexpression of CEs was verified. Besides, VPCPP was utilized for imaging the variations of the two microenvironment parameters and CEs in the inflammation model. Finally, VPCPP was able to image the tumor ex vivo and in vivo through two channels and one channel separately, as well as to visualize the kidneys and liver ex vivo with dual emissions, which indicated that the probe had great potential for imaging applications such as medical diagnosis, preclinical research, and imaging-guided surgery.

  **VPCPP is a multifunctional near-infrared (NIR) probe enabling real-time, dual-channel imaging of microviscosity, micropolarity, and carboxylesterase activity in living cells. When applied to HepG2 cells, only sorafenib, a known ferroptosis inducer, triggered a unique pattern—increased microviscosity (red) and reduced CE activity (blue)—which the authors interpreted as a ferroptosis signature. However, no ferroptosis-specific tests (lipid ROS staining, ferrostatin-1 rescue, GPX4 or ACSL4 analysis) were performed, and other regulated cell deaths were not excluded. Thus, while VPCPP offers a promising optical readout of cell-state changes, its ferroptosis claim remains inferred rather than proven, requiring biochemical validation.**

VPCPP is a multifunctional probe enabling the detection of multiple environmental conditions (microviscosity, micropolarity, and carboxylesterase activity). In addition, the authors claimed to identify a specific ferroptosis phenotype: increased microviscosity and reduced carboxylesterase activity. However, no ferroptosis-specific tests were performed, and other regulated cell death pathways were not excluded. Therefore, while VPCPP is a valuable tool for high-throughput cellular imaging, its ability to specifically detect ferroptosis remains limited.
