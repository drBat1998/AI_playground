> Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common pathological mechanism in many retinal diseases, which can lead to cell death via mitochondrial dysfunction.  Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), which is mainly located in the outer  mitochondrial membrane, is the gatekeeper of mitochondria. The permeability of  mitochondrial membrane can be regulated by controlling the oligomerization of  VDAC1. However, the functional mechanism of VDAC1 in retinal I/R injury was  unclear. Our results demonstrate that oxygen-glucose deprivation and  re-oxygenation (OGD/R) injury leads to apoptosis, necroptosis, and mitochondrial  dysfunction of R28 cells. The OGD/R injury increases the levels of VDAC1  oligomerization. Inhibition of VDAC1 oligomerization by VBIT-12 rescued  mitochondrial dysfunction by OGD/R and also reduced apoptosis/necroptosis of R28  cells. In vivo, the use of VBIT-12 significantly reduced aHIOP-induced neuronal  death (apoptosis/necroptosis) in the rat retina. Our findings indicate that VDAC1  oligomers may open and enlarge mitochondrial membrane pores during OGD/R injury,  leading to the release of death-related factors in mitochondria, resulting in  apoptosis and necroptosis. This study provides a potential therapeutic strategy  against ocular diseases caused by I/R injury.

> apoptosis was associated with increased expression of VDAC1 and its oligomerization, which led to the formation of enlarged pores in the mitochondrial membrane, and the release of pro-apoptotic proteins by the mitochondria, resulting in cell death in inflammatory bowel disease and refractory epilepsy

> 2.5. Propidium iodide (PI) staining  At the indicated times points, the cell cultures were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with 10 μg/mL PI dye (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in a 5 % CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, the cell cultures were washed three times with PBS to remove the remaining PI dye. Then, the cell cultures were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PF) for 15 min at room temperature (RT), followed by washing three times with PBS and counterstaining with Hoechst for 5 min at RT. Images were acquired with a fluorescence microscope under the same exposure time. The PI-positive cells were counted by Image J software (NIH, Baltimore, MD, USA).

> Erica de Sousa et al. reported that the inhibition of VDAC1 decreased cell death in an in vitro model of oxidative stress, and the inhibition of VDAC1 oligomerization by DIDS (an inhibitor of VDAC1 activation) decreased the loss of secondary cells exposed to mechanical trauma in vitro (de Sousa et al., 2022).

> Although the metabolites are still oxidized during this process, the loss of the entire inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) proton gradient leads to ROS accumulation after a decrease in ATP synthesis (Marmolino et al., 2010; Martinon, 2010).

> In addition, we found that VDAC1 oligomerization may be involved in the process of necroptosis, which was not previously reported. Our findings suggest that I/R can induce apoptosis and necroptosis of neurons (Yan et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2023).
