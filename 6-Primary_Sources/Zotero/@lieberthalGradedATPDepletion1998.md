> The mechanisms of cell death induced by ATP depletion were studied in primary cultures of mouse proximal tubular (MPT) cells. Graded ATP depletion, ranging in severity from ∼2 to 70% of control levels, was induced by incubating cells with either antimycin or 2-deoxyglucose, with varying concentrations of dextrose. We found that cells subjected to ATP depletion below ∼15% of control died uniformly of necrosis. In contrast, cells subjected to ATP depletion between ∼25 and 70% of control all died by apoptosis. The rapidity of cell death was proportional to the severity of reduction of cell ATP content and was independent of the mechanism of cell death. Renal growth factors, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and high-dose insulin, did not ameliorate apoptotic cell death induced by ATP depletion. We conclude that ATP depletion can cause either necrosis or apoptosis in MPT cells. Furthermore, we have identified a narrow range of ATP depletion (∼15 to 25% of control) representing a threshold that determines whether cells die by necrosis or apoptosis.

> We determined the mechanism of cell death by many approaches, including DNA electrophoresis, phasecontrast microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and electron microscopy. In all three conditions for which ATP was severely depleted (#15% of control), a smear pattern of DNA degradation, typical of necrosis, was found on DNA electrophoresis, without any laddering, to suggest apoptosis of even a proportion of the cells (Fig. 4, lanes 2–4). Phase-contrast micrographs of cells subjected to the same degree of ATP depletion demonstrated cell swelling and trypan blue positivity, both features long recognized as typical of necrosis. Staining of nuclei of these cells with H-33342 revealed that the nuclei of cells subjected to severe ATP depletion demonstrated normal chromatin morphology (Figs. 6C and 7A). However, in contrast to viable cells which excluded PI (Fig. 6B), most of the cells subjected to severe ATP depletion still adherent to the monolayer (Fig. 6D) and all cells that spontaneously detached from the monolayer (Fig. 7B) were PI positive. Finally, electron microscopy of cells subjected to severe ATP depletion for 6 h showed the classic features of necrosis (Fig. 8).

> In contrast to the effects of severe ATP depletion, MPT cells subjected to more moderate reductions in cell ATP (25–70% of control) (Fig. 1) died by apoptosis.
