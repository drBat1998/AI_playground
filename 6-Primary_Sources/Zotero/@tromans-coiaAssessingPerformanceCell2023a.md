> Quantitative microscopy is a powerful method for performing phenotypic screens from which image-based profiling can extract a wealth of information, termed profiles. These profiles can be used to elucidate the changes in cellular phenotypes across cell populations from different patient samples or following genetic or chemical perturbations. One such image-based profiling method is the Cell Painting assay, which provides morphological insight through the imaging of eight cellular compartments. Here, we examine the performance of the Cell Painting assay across multiple high-throughput microscope systems and find that all are compatible with this assay. Furthermore, we determine independently for each microscope system the best performing settings, providing those who wish to adopt this assay an ideal starting point for their own assays. We also explore the impact of microscopy setting changes in the Cell Painting assay and find that few dramatically reduce the quality of a Cell Painting profile, regardless of the microscope used.

> We initially found that data sets taken with 20X magnification objectives typically yielded better profile strength when compared to data sets taken with 10X or 40X objectives (Figure 1A). We also found that experiments that imaged three or more sites per well tended to have an increased profile strength (Figure 1B, Figure S1BC). The objective NA did not appear to yield a difference in our sample (Figure S1A).

> We have found that setting choices that increase the cell count, such as decreased magnification and increased number of sites, typically has a positive impact on profile strength. However, due to the interconnected nature of these settings with cell count, it is difficult to clearly conclude those which impact profile strength the most. We also found that simultaneous excitation of four channels leads to bleedthrough in the Cell Painting assay, which can negatively impact interpretation of imagederived features in downstream analysis.  We also found that some settings have a comparatively lower impact on the Cell Painting assay, such as the number of z-planes acquired and detector binning. The number of z-planes can be reduced and detector binning increased with little impact on profile strength, both of which can also afford faster image acquisition.

> Taken together, a general set of recommendations for the Cell Painting assay could be: to capture five fluorescent channels and brightfield using a magnification of 20X across four to nine sites or ~2,500 cells per well, whichever comes first. An increase in binning and a reduction in z-planes can also be explored, depending on the unbinned pixel size and the resolution of any features that are especially interesting to the researcher performing the assay. When following these basic guidelines, Cell Painting can be a powerful tool capable of detecting many phenotypes, across many different kinds of microscopes.
