> PURPOSE: Pellino3, an ubiquitin E3 ligase, prevents the formation of the death-induced signaling complex in response to TNF-α by targeting  receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), and bioinformatics analysis  predicted an interaction between Pellino3 and caspofungin, a common antifungal  drug used in clinics. This study aimed to explore the effect of caspofungin on  brain injury in ischemic stroke and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Ischemic  stroke injury was induced in Sprague Dawley rats by occlusion of the middle  cerebral artery (MCA) for 2 h, followed by 24 h reperfusion. PC12 cells were  deprived of both oxygen and glucose for 8 h and then were cultured for 24 h with  oxygen and glucose to mimic an ischemic stroke in vitro. RESULTS: Animal  experiments showed brain injury (increase in neurological deficit score and  infarct volume) concomitant with a downregulation of Pellino3, a decreased  ubiquitination of RIPK1, and an up-regulation of necroptosis-associated proteins  [RIPK1, RIPK3, mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), p-RIPK1, p-RIPK3,  and p-MLKL]. Administration of caspofungin (6 mg/kg, i.m.) at 1 h and 6 h after  ischemia significantly improved neurological function, reduced infarct volume,  up-regulated Pellino3 levels, increased RIPK1 ubiquitination, and down-regulated  protein levels of RIPK1, p-RIPK1, p-RIPK3, and p-MLKL. PC12 cells deprived of  oxygen/glucose developed signs of cellular injury (LDH release and necroptosis)  concomitant with downregulation of Pellino3, decreased ubiquitination of RIPK1,  and elevated necroptosis-associated proteins. These changes were reversed by  overexpression of Pellino3. CONCLUSION: We conclude that Pellino3 has an  important role in counteracting necroptosis via ubiquitination of RIPK1 and  caspofungin can suppress the brain cell necroptosis in ischemic stroke through  upregulation of Pellino3.

> In this study, by using the ischemic stroke animal and cell models, we explored the effect of caspofungin  on ischemic brain injury and the potential mechanisms. The two major ndings of this study are  summarized as follows: (1) the protein levels of Pellino3 were downregulated in the stroke rat brains in  vivo or in the hypoxia-treated PC12 cells in vitro concomitant with the decreased ubiquitination of RIPK1,  meanwhile, the levels of necroptosis-associated proteins (RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL) were increased while  the interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3 was enhanced; and (2) Up-regulation of Pellino3 with  caspofungin or overexpression of Pellino3 mitigated the stroke brain injury in vivo or the hypoxic injury in  the PC12 cells due to reduction of RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis. To the best of our  knowledge, we have identi ed a novel function of Pellino 3 in regulating the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway  for the rst time, and we have also demonstrated for the rst time that caspofungin reduces the stroke  brain injury via suppression of necroptosis due to up-regulation of Pellino3.
