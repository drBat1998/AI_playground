> PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the impact of GSK840 on retinal neuronal injury after retinal ischemia/reperfusion (IR) and its associated mechanism.
METHODS: We established an in vivo mouse model of IR and an in vitro model of oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGDR) in primary mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). GSK840, a small-molecule compound, was used to specifically inhibit RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis. Retinal structure and function evaluation was performed by using hematoxylin and eosin staining, optical coherence tomography, and electroretinography. Propidium Iodide (PI) staining was used for detection of necroptotic cell death, whereas Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence were used to assess necroptosis-related proteins and inner retinal neurons.
RESULTS: RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis was rapidly activated in RGCs following retinal IR or OGDR. GSK840 helped maintain relatively normal inner retinal structure and thickness by preserving inner retinal neurons, particularly RGCs. Meanwhile, GSK840 ameliorated IR-induced visual dysfunction, as evidenced by the improved amplitudes of photopic negative response, a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potentials. And GSK840 treatment significantly reduced the population of PI+ RGCs after injury. Mechanistically, GSK840 ameliorated RGC necroptosis by inhibiting the RIPK3/MLKL pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: GSK840 exerts protective effects against retinal neuronal injury after IR by inhibiting RIPK3/MLKL-mediated RGC necroptosis. GSK840 may represent a protective strategy for RGC degeneration in ischemic retinopathy.

> or the quantification of immunostaining on retinal section, six eyeballs were used in each experimental group. From each eyeball, three discontinuous retinal sections passing through the optic nerve were randomly selected. Within each of these selected sections, one specific area was chosen for analysis, resulting in a total of three areas from three sections being used to calculate average values for each eyeball. Mean fluorescence intensity analysis of phosphorylated RIPK3 (p-RIPK3) expression was conducted by measuring the average pixel intensity of p-RIPK3 within the region of interest. Threshold settings for defining the  region of interest remained consistent across all images. To correct for background intensity, the background fluorescence intensity was measured and subtracted. After the background subtraction, mean fluorescence intensity values were normalized to the control group. All labeled cells were manually counted using the Multi-point Tool of Image J software (National Institutes of Health).
