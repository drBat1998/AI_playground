> Cell death and subsequent inflammation are 2 key pathological changes occurring in cerebral ischemia. Active microglia/macrophages play a double-edged role  depending on the balance of their M1/M2 phenotypes. Necrosis is the predominant  type of cell death following ischemia. However, how necrotic cells modulate the  M1/M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages remains poorly investigated. Here, we  reported that ischemia induces a rapid RIPK3/MLKL-mediated neuron-dominated  necroptosis, a type of programmed necrosis. Ablating RIPK3 or MLKL could switch  the activation of microglia/macrophages from M1 to the M2 type in the ischemic  cortex. Conditioned medium of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated wild-type  (WT) neurons induced M1 polarization, while that of RIPK3-/- neurons favored M2  polarization. OGD treatment induces proinflammatory IL-18 and TNFα in WT but not  in RIPK3-/- neurons, which in turn upregulate anti-inflammatory IL-4 and IL-10.  Furthermore, the expression of Myd88-a common downstream adaptor of toll-like  receptors-is significantly upregulated in the microglia/macrophages of ischemic  WT but not of RIPK3-/- or MLKL-/- cortices. Antagonizing the function of Myd88  could phenocopy the effects of RIPK3/MLKL-knockout on the polarization of  microglia/macrophages and was neuroprotective. Our data revealed a novel role of  necroptotic neurons in modulating the M1/M2 balance of microglia/macrophages in  the ischemic cortex, possibly through Myd88 signaling.

> For the culture of primary cortical astrocytes, primary cells were isolated from the cortices of P2-4 neonatal pups and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Astrocytes were purified as described, with modifications (Hamby et al. 2006; Gingras et al. 2007). Briefly, when cells reached confluence, the culture was purified by shaking at 260 rpm overnight, and the suspended microglia and oligodendrocytes were discarded. The cells were then cultured with 8 μM of arabinoside C (Ara C) for 3 days, followed by a 1-h L-leucine methyl ester (LME, 60 μM) treatment. The cell shaking, passaging, Ara C and LME treatment were repeated once to ensure that 99% of the cells used for experiments were GFAP-positive.

  **Neurons are prevalent cells that die by necroptosis or other necrosis like death during first 3 days after ischemia. Next prominent cells are astrocytes that die after 5 days.**

> To explore whether necroptosis contributes to ischemiainduced necrosis, we next examined the expression of RIPK3, MLKL and phosphorylated MLKL (pMLKL) in the ischemic cortex. Western blotting demonstrated that RIPK3, MLKL and pMLKL were upregulated at 24 h postischemia, and this upregulation persisted through 7 dpi (Fig. 2A).

> In the present study, by examining the expression of RIPK3 and MLKL, we observed that a neuron-dominant necroptosis occurs in the first 3 days after ischemia. From 5 dpi onward, the major cell types, which undergo necroptosis, changed to astrocytes. This time-dependent switch of neuron-to-astrocyte necroptosis reflects the pathological changes of cerebral ischemia and may contribute to the development of secondary injury. Acute

  **The most important inside is that neurons are prevalent cell type that died by necroptosis after I/R injury.**
