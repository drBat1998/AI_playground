# Abstract 
Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP)-dependent cell death is a form of necrotic cell death that is driven by mitochondrial dysfunction by the opening of the mPTP and is triggered by increases in matrix levels of Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species. This form of cell death has been implicated in ischemic injuries of the heart and brain as well as numerous degenerative diseases in the brain and skeletal muscle. This review focuses on the molecular triggers and regulators of mPTP-dependent necrosis in the context of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. Research over the past 50 years has led to the identity of regulators and putative pore-forming components of the mPTP. Finally, downstream consequences of activation of the mPTP as well as ongoing questions and areas of research are discussed. These questions pose a particular interest as targeting the mPTP could potentially represent an efficacious therapeutic strategy to reduce infarct size following an ischemic event.

> [!cite] 
> The mPTP is a non-selective pore  within the inner mitochondrial membrane that is permeable to solutes up to 1.5 kDa in size [1]. Pore opening  leads to the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, organelle swelling, and eventual rupture [2].

> Mitochondria can absorb and store execive Ca. Ca can trigger mPTP openining if mitochondria capability of Ca retention (CRC) would exeeded. When this heppened mPTP opens and release the Ca that had been acumulated before CRC level was reached.

> [!note] 
> CypD is a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases. Absence of CypD leads to increase level of Ca that need to damage mitochondria. Interested fact should be mentioned, CypD inhibition does not completly ameliorate mPTP-derived mitochondria swelling; mPTP opening in case of higher level of Ca become CypD independent.

[[MPT-driven regulated necrosis]]
[[mPTP and necroptosis]]
The Mitochondrial permeability transition pore(mPTP) is a non-selective pore within the inner mitochondrial membrane. The pore opening leads to the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, organelle swelling, and eventual rupture.
One of the main triggers of mPTP permeability is Ca. Mitochondria can absorb and store excessive Ca. Ca can trigger mPTP opening if the mitochondria's capability of Ca retention (CRC) is exceeded. When this happened, mPTP opens and releases the Ca that had been accumulated before the CRC level was reached, followed by organelle swelling and eventual rupture.
