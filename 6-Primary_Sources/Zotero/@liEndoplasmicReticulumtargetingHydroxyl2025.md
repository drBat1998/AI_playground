> The real-time and in situ detection of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is helpful to understand ferroptosis at its very early stage due to the crucial role of ˙OH in the ER in ferroptosis initiation. Herein, an ER-targeting ˙OH fluorescent probe (ER-OH) has been developed, which showed a large fluorescence increase at 645 nm in response to ˙OH. ER-OH was applied to monitor ferroptosis by fluorescence imaging, revealing a significant increase of the ˙OH level in the ER during this process. With the imaging of ER-OH, a high-throughput screening method was developed to evaluate the anti-ferroptosis activity of a series of natural protectants. Through this screening, the natural flavonoid derivative icariside I was found for the first time to be highly effective in inhibiting ferroptosis by direct scavenging of the excess cytotoxic oxides (e.g. ˙OH and lipid peroxides) and restoring the level of GPX4. ER-OH could also be used for in vivo imaging of ˙OH in a mouse tumor model. This work provides not only a new tool for ferroptosis monitoring but also a direct insight into the regulation mechanism of ferroptosis and development of new drugs for ferroptosis-related diseases.

> In this work, we report such an ER-targeting cOH uorescent probe ER-OH, which can be used to image ferroptosis. As shown in Scheme 1A, ER-OH is designed based on a stable and bright coumarin uorophore. In order to increase the sensitivity of the probe, dihydroquinoline, which has specic and sensitive reaction to cOH,26,36 was selected as the recognition group. Furthermore, an ER-targetable p-methyl benzenesulfonamide group was introduced to enable the accumulation of the resulting probe in ER.37 Aer reaction with cOH, ER-OH underwent hydrogen abstraction to form the larger p-conjugation and donor–p–acceptor (D–p–A) structure of product 1 (Scheme 1A), which resulted in a large uorescence increase at 645 nm, thus favoring the sensitive cOH detection in the ER. EROH has been applied to monitor the cOH variations in the ER during ferroptosis. Most importantly, based on the uorescence imaging of ER-OH and using the initiator of ferroptosis (cOH in the ER) as a monitoring indicator, a high-throughput screening method has been developed to evaluate the anti-ferroptosis activity of a series of natural protectants (Scheme 1B). Furthermore, the anti-ferroptosis effects of the screened natural protectant icariside I were investigated, revealing its great potential for studying ferroptosis-related diseases. 

Ferroptosis is a regulated cell-death process marked by necrotic morphology and driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Although lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes is well established, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)—the earliest and most vulnerable site of this oxidative damage—has been poorly explored. Li et al. (2025) developed ER-OH, a fluorescent probe that selectively targets the ER and emits far-red fluorescence upon reaction with hydroxyl radicals (·OH), one of the principal initiators of lipid peroxidation. Using ER-OH, they visualised hydroxyl-radical bursts in the ER during ferroptosis and implemented a high-throughput imaging assay to screen natural compounds for anti-ferroptotic activity. The screen identified icariside I, a flavonoid derivative that suppressed ferroptosis by scavenging ·OH and lipid peroxides and restoring GPX4 levels. The ER-OH probe, therefore, provides both a sensitive tool for early ferroptosis monitoring and a platform for discovering ferroptosis inhibitors.
