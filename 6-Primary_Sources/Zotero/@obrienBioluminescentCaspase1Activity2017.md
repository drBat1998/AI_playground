> Inflammasomes are protein complexes induced by diverse inflammatory stimuli that activate caspase-1, resulting in the processing and release of cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18, and pyroptosis, an immunogenic form of cell death. To provide a homogeneous method for detecting caspase-1 activity, we developed a bioluminescent, plate-based assay that combines a substrate, Z-WEHD-aminoluciferin, with a thermostable luciferase in an optimized lytic reagent added directly to cultured cells. Assay specificity for caspase-1 is conferred by inclusion of a proteasome inhibitor in the lytic reagent and by use of a caspase-1 inhibitor to confirm activity. This approach enables a specific and rapid determination of caspase-1 activation. Caspase-1 activity is stable in the reagent thereby providing assay convenience and flexibility. Using this assay system, caspase-1 activation has been determined in THP-1 cells following treatment with α-hemolysin, LPS, nigericin, gramicidin, MSU, R848, Pam3CSK4, and flagellin. Caspase-1 activation has also been demonstrated in treated J774A.1 mouse macrophages, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from mice, as well as in human primary monocytes. Caspase-1 activity was not detected in treated BMDMs derived from Casp1-/- mice, further confirming the specificity of the assay. Caspase-1 activity can be measured directly in cultured cells using the lytic reagent, or caspase-1 activity released into medium can be monitored by assay of transferred supernatant. The caspase-1 assay can be multiplexed with other assays to monitor additional parameters from the same cells, such as IL-1β release or cell death. The caspase-1 assay in combination with a sensitive real-time monitor of cell death allows one to accurately establish pyroptosis. This assay system provides a rapid, convenient, and flexible method to specifically and quantitatively monitor caspase-1 activation in cells in a plate-based format. This will allow a more efficient and effective assessment of inflammasome activation as well as enable high-throughput screening for inflammasome modulators.

> Z-WEHD-aminoluciferin substrate for caspase-1 was tested and shown to be capable of measuring caspase-1 activity in a variety of inflammasome activation models. Total caspase-1 activity can be monitored by adding the lytic reagent directly to the cell culture well. Alternatively, caspase-1 activity released into the medium can be measured independently from intracellular caspase-1 activity by transferring the culture supernatant to a new well. Despite some crossreactivity between caspases and tetrapeptide substrates (McStay et al., 2008), we show that by including the inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CHO, at a caspase-1 specific concentration, we can distinguish caspase-1 activity from the activity of other caspases, and pyroptosis from apoptosis.

Caspase 1 activity, crucial for pyroptosis, was for some time detected by commercial available bioluminescent, plate-based assay.
