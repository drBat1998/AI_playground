>
> Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with few available treatment options. The pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia involves both early phase tissue damage, characterized by neuronal death, inflammation, and blood-brain barrier breakdown, followed by late phase neurovascular recovery. It is becoming clear that any promising treatment strategy must target multiple points in the evolution of ischemic injury to provide substantial therapeutic benefit. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a class of drugs that increase the acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins to activate transcription, enhance gene expression, and modify the function of target proteins. Acetylation homeostasis is often disrupted in neurological conditions, and accumulating evidence suggests that HDAC inhibitors have robust protective properties in many preclinical models of these disorders, including ischemic stroke. Specifically, HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A, valproic acid, sodium butyrate, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid have been shown to provide robust protection against excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, ER stress, apoptosis, inflammation, and bloodbrain barrier breakdown. Concurrently, these agents can also promote angiogenesis, neurogenesis and stem cell migration to dramatically reduce infarct volume and improve functional recovery after experimental cerebral ischemia. In the following review, we discuss the mechanisms by which HDAC inhibitors exert these protective effects and provide evidence for their strong potential to ultimately improve stroke outcome in patients.

> In the most severely affected region, known as the ischemic core, limited blood supply rapidly prevents the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and in turn leads to the failure of ATP-dependent ion pumps such as Na+/K+ ATPase. The subsequent Na+ influx, glutamate accumulation, and Ca2+ overload results in cytotoxic edema, acidosis, organelle and membrane failure, and finally necrotic cell death [5–7]. The area immediately adjacent to the core infarct zone, the ischemic penumbra, is subjected to more moderate reductions in blood flow, and thus more delayed injury mechanisms [8].

> For example, in one study mice were pretreated with 5 mg/kg TSA by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection once per day for 14 days and then subjected to 1 hour MCAO. At 24 hours post-injury, infarct volume was reduced by approximately 24% compared to vehicle-treated MCAO animals [54].

> Soon afterwards, Leng and Chuang demonstrated that VPA, TSA, and 4-PB showed robust protection against glutamate-induced, NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in CGCs.

> In this study, HDAC inhibitor exposure was associated with an upregulation of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21waf1/cip1, which was also upregulated after protective SB treatment in a rat model of focal ischemia. p21waf1/cip1 seemed to be acting via a noncanonical protective role in the cytoplasm, and while its overexpression was sufficient to prevent oxidative stress-induced neuronal death, it was not always necessary for the protective effects of HDAC inhibitors.

> In line with this mechanism, VPA pretreatment in monocytic cells also suppressed the production of NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) [96]. The strong anti-inflammatory effects of HDAC inhibition against LPS stimulation have also been established in neuron-glia cocultures from rat midbrain. In this model, pretreatment with VPA, TSA, or SB protected neurons, notably dopaminergic neurons, from LPS-stimulated neurotoxicity; these effects were in part due to HDAC inhibition-mediated production and release of glial cell linederived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) from astrocytes [98–99]
