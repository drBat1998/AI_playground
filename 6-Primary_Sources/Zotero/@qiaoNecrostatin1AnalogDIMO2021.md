> AIM: It has been reported that necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) is a specific necroptosis inhibitor that could attenuate programmed cell death induced by myocardial  ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study aimed to observe the effect and  mechanism of novel Nec-1 analog  (Z)-5-(3,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-imine-1-methylimidazolin-4-1 (DIMO) on myocardial  I/R injury. METHODS: Male SD rats underwent I/R injury with or without different  doses of DIMO (1, 2, or 4 mg/kg) treatment. Isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes  were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) treatment with  or without DIMO (0.1, 1, 10, or 100 μM). Myocardial infarction was measured by  TTC staining. Cardiomyocyte injury was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase assay  (LDH) and flow cytometry. Receptor-interacting protein 1 kinase (RIP1K) and  autophagic markers were detected by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting  analysis. Molecular docking of DIMO into the ATP binding site of RIP1K was  performed using GLIDE. RESULTS: DIMO at doses of 1 or 2 mg/kg improved myocardial  infarct size. However, the DIMO 4 mg/kg dose was ineffective. DIMO at the dose of  0.1 μM decreased LDH leakage and the ratio of PI-positive cells followed by OGD/R  treatment. I/R or OGD/R increased RIP1K expression and in its interaction with  RIP3K, as well as impaired myocardial autophagic flux evidenced by an increase in  LC3-II/I ratio, upregulated P62 and Beclin-1, and activated cathepsin B and L. In  contrast, DIMO treatment reduced myocardial cell death and reversed the above  mentioned changes in RIP1K and autophagic flux caused by I/R and OGD/R. DIMO  binds to RIP1K and inhibits RIP1K expression in a homology modeling and ligand  docking. CONCLUSION: DIMO exerts cardioprotection against I/R- or OGD/R-induced  injury, and its mechanisms may be associated with the reduction in RIP1K  activation and restoration impaired autophagic flux.

> In this study, we have demonstrated that Nec-1 analog DIMO administered at the onset of reperfusion contributed to cardioprotective effect against myocardial I/R injury. DIMO inhibited RIP1K expression, restored myocardial I/R-impaired autophagic flux and decreased active-cathepsin B and L expression in rats, which is likely the underlying mechanism of cardioprotection conferred by DIMO. 


[[DIMO, analog Nec1 has cardioprotective properties during myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. ]]

“However, the short half-life of Nec-1 severely affected the efficacy of its drug treatment. Therefore, a structural analog of Nec-1 (Z)-5-(3,5dimethoxybenzylidene)-2-imino-1-methyl imidazolidin-4-1 (DIMO) was synthesized in our laboratory to elucidate its effect and mechanism on myocardial I/R injury.” ([Qiao et al., 2021, p. 190](zotero://select/library/items/ALEULP5U)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TDX7FAZS?page=2&annotation=CR3Y4PXW))
