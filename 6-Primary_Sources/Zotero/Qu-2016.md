> abstract:: Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) is a critical molecule mediating cell necroptosis. However, its role in brain injury remains obscure. We first  investigated the functions and mechanisms of MLKL in mediating neuronal damage in  developing brain after hypoxia-ischemia. Neuronal necroptosis was induced by  oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) plus caspase inhibitor zVAD treatment  (OGD/zVAD). We found that two important necroptosis related proteins,  receptor-interacting protein 1 and 3 (RIP1, RIP3) were upregulated. Furthermore,  the interaction of RIP1-RIP3 with MLKL increased. Inhibition of MLKL through  siRNA diminished RIP1-RIP3-MLKL interaction and attenuated neuronal death induced  by OGD/zVAD. The translocation of oligomerized MLKL to the neuronal membrane  leading to the injury of cellular membrane is the possible new mechanism of  neuronal necroptosis. Animal experiment with neonatal rats further proved that  MLKL inhibition attenuated brain damage induced by hypoxia-ischemia. These  findings suggest that MLKL is a target to attenuate brain damage in developing  brain.

### Unity
%% begin notes %%
[[Necroptosis plays an important role in oxygen deprivation in the developing brain]]. 

Transfection is a good technique to reduce necroptosis activity. 

[[Could we use fixation as a stop solution for following qPCR methods?]]

[[immunoprecipitation following WB is a good technique to check some relationships between proteins. ]]

> si-RIP3, Ribobio, Guangzhou, China), MLKL (ID690743) (si-MLKL, Ribobio), or  nonspecific sequences (Scrambled) (si-Scr, Ribobio) without modification were  synthesized for cell treatment by Ribobio. Ten nmol of siRNA was transfected into  cells. The same concentration of nonspecific sequences was used as scrambled control.  Cells were cultured for 24 h and subjected to OGD.

> Crude cell membrane fraction  Cells (2.5×106 cells) were detached from the culture plates with a non-enzymatic  solution consisting of HBSS (Sigma) with 1mM EDTA (Sigma) and washed twice  with PBS (Sigma). Cells were re-suspended in 1ml of the fractionation buffer (250  mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES at pH7.4, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA  and 1 mM EGTA) and placed on ice for 10 min. Cells were disrupted by freezing with  liquid nitrogen for 5 min and then were thawed on ice, repeated three times. The  lysates were passed through a 25G needle (BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA) for 10  times. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 750g for 5 min.  The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 10,000g for 5 min. The  supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000g in an Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge  (Beckman Coulter, California, USA) for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant containing  cytosolic proteins were concentrated using an acetone precipitation method. The  pellets containing membrane proteins were washed with the fractionation buffer and  were re-centrifuged at 100,000g for 45 min. The pellets were collected and lysed in  M2 buffer (20 mM Tris, pH7, 0.5% NP40, 250 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA,  2 mM DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 20 mM glycerol phosphate, 1  mM sodium vanadate and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). For reducing gel analysis, normal  SDS-PAGE was performed as described below. For non-reducing gel analysis, cells  were lysed in M2 buffer without DTT and separated by SDS-PAGE without  mercaptoethanol.

> Immunoprecipitation  Cells were homogenized in cold lysis buffer, lysis was precleared by adding  resuspended Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz), incubate at 4°C for 30 min,  centrifuged for 8 min at 2,500g, the pellet was discarded. Protein (250ug) was  combined with anti-MLKL antibody (2 μg, Abcam) and incubated overnight, gently  mixing at 4°C. Immobilized protein A (Life) 100 μL was added to the  antigen–antibody complex and gently mixed at room temperature for 2 h. To remove  any unbound protein, the samples were washed 4 times with 0.5mL of  immunoprecipitation buffer (Life) and centrifuged for 3 min at 2,500g. The  supernatant was discarded after each wash. The pellet was washed with 0.5mL  distilled H2O, centrifuged for 3 min at 2,500g, and the supernatant discarded. The  beads were resuspended in 50 μL of 2× treatment buffer and boiled for 5 min, then  centrifuged at 14,000g for 5 seconds. The supernatant (20 μL per lane) was loaded  onto a gel for SDS-PAGE. Blots were incubated overnight at 4oC with anti-RIP1,  anti-RIP3, or anti-MKLK, then exposed to corresponding secondary antibody and  developed with enhanced chemiluminescence. The same amount of irrelevant mouse  IgG (Santa Cruz) was used as the nonspecific binding control.
