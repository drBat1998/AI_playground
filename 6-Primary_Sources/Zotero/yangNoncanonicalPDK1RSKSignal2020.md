> Necroptosis induction in vitro often requires caspase-8 (Casp8) inhibition by zVAD because pro-Casp8 cleaves RIP1 to disintegrate the necrosome. It has been unclear how the Casp8 blockade of necroptosis is eliminated naturally. Here, we show that pro-Casp8 within the necrosome can be inactivated by phosphorylation at Thr265 (pC8T265). pC8T265 occurs in vitro in various necroptotic cells and in the cecum of TNF-treated mice. p90 RSK is the kinase of pro-Casp8. It is activated by a mechanism that does not need ERK but PDK1, which is recruited to the RIP1-RIP3-MLKL-containing necrosome. Phosphorylation of pro-Casp8 at Thr265 can substitute for zVAD to permit necroptosis in vitro. pC8T265 mimic T265E knockin mice are embryonic lethal due to unconstrained necroptosis, and the pharmaceutical inhibition of RSK-mediated pC8T265 diminishes TNF-induced cecum damage and lethality in mice by halting necroptosis. Thus, phosphorylation of pro-Casp8 at Thr265 by RSK is an intrinsic mechanism for passing the Casp8 checkpoint of necroptosis.

> However, none of them was shown to participate in necroptosis. In this study, we discovered that the phosphorylation of pro-Casp8 at Thr265 by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) abolished Casp8 activity, leading to the preservation of necrosome integrity and subsequent necroptosis.

> Thus, in addition to cFLIPL, the presence of RIP3 and MLKL in the necrosome is required for the suppression of pro-Casp8 self-processing (Figure 1A). As the suppression of pro-Casp8 self-processing couples with the capability of proCasp8 to block necroptosis, the intrinsic mechanism that disarms the pro-Casp8 gatekeeper of necroptosis should only be activated after MLKL recruitment (Figure 1A).

> s expected, zVAD was not required for necrosome formation in the cells reconstituted with T265E or the enzymatically inactive C362S mutant (Figure 1I), demonstrating that Thr265 phosphorylation of pro-Casp8 can substitute for zVAD in diminishing the blockade of necroptosis by pro-Casp8.

> Meanwhile, zVAD was still able to promote necrosome formation in Rsk1 KO L929 cells (Figure 3I), confirming the substitutable nature between zVAD and RSK in preventing pro-Casp8 from stopping the necroptotic process.

> Thus, the recruitment of RSK1 to the necrosome occurs after MLKL being a part of the necrosome. The recruitment of RSK1 does not require proCasp8, FADD, and RIP1 since RSK1 can be recruited to the RIP3-MLKL complex induced by artificial RIP3 dimerization

> Thus, the ERK-independent activation of RSK by PDK1 inactivates proCasp8 and promotes necroptosis.
