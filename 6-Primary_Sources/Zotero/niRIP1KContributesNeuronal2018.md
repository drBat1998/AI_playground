> Although the receptor-interacting protein 1 kinase (RIP1K)-regulated necroptosis can be evoked by cerebral ischemia, the effects of RIP1K in mediating neuronal and astrocytic cell death and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study evaluates the contribution of RIP1K to ischemic stroke-induced neuronal and astrocytic cell death, and the activation of autophagic-lysosomal pathway. Using an in vitro oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in primary cultured neurons or astrocytes and a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model in rats or mice, we observed the role of RIP1K in the ischemic neuronal and astrocytic cell death and the underlying mechanisms by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of RIP1K. pMCAO or OGD condition led to an increase in RIP1K, RIP3K and RIP1K-RIP3K complex. RIP1K knockdown or necrostatin-1 (Nec-1, a specific inhibitor of RIP1K) treatment reduced infarct volume, improved neurological deficits, increased microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels, and attenuated neuronal or astrocytic necrotic cell death in the ischemic cortex. RIP1K knockdown decreased RIP1K-RIP3K complex formation, light chain 3 II (LC3II) and active cathepsin B levels and lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP). Furthermore, a combination of Nec-1 and an inhibitor of autophagy or cathepsin B produced an enhancement of protective effect on neuronal or astrocytic cell death. RIP1K-mediated necroptosis may play important roles in ischemia-induced neuronal and astrocytic cell death through the activation of autophagic-lysosomal pathway.

> Accumulating evidence suggests a potential crosstalk 556 between necroptosis and autophagy (Nikoletopoulou 557 et al., 2013). Autophagy is activated during necroptosis, 558 and is associated with the conversion of the 559 microtubule-associated protein, LC-3I to LC-3II 560 (Degterev et al., 2005, 2008; He et al., 2009; 561 Rosenbaum et al., 2010; Vandenabeele et al., 2010; 562 Dong et al., 2014). But it is largely unknown whether 563 RIP1K plays a role in the activation of autophagy during 564 ischemia-induced neuronal and astrocytic cell necropto565 sis. We found that pharmacological or genetic inhibition 566 of RIP1K decreases the LC3II levels in the ischemic cor567 tex and also in OGD-induced neuronal and astrocytic cell 568 injury, suggesting that autophagy is activated during 569 RIP1K-mediated neuronal and astrocytic cell necroptosis 570 in ischemic stroke. The intriguing novel finding in the cur571 rent study is that RIP1K knockdown stabilized OGD572 induced lysosomal membrane instability and inhibited 573 the OGD-induced activation of cathepsin B in neurons 574 and astrocytes, indicating that RIP1K can mediate lysoso575 mal membrane instability in ischemic neurons and astro576 cytes. Since excessive autophagy induces LMP and 577 inhibition of autophagy prevents LMP in non-nerve cells 578 (Seglen and Gordon, 1982; Hoyvik et al., 1991; 579 Blommaart et al., 1997; Hsu et al., 2009), our data imply 580 that RIP1K mediated-lysosomal membrane instability in 581 ischemic neurons and astrocytes is, at least partially, 582 associated with the activation of autophagy. Namely, the
