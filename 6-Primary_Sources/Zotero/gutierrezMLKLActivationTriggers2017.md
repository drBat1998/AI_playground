> Necroptosis is a form of programmed cell death defined by activation of the kinase receptor interacting protein kinase 3 and its downstream effector, the pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). Activated MLKL translocates to the cell membrane and disrupts it, leading to loss of cellular ion homeostasis. In this study, we use a system in which this event can be specifically triggered by a small-molecule ligand to show that MLKL activation is sufficient to induce the processing and release of bioactive IL-1β. MLKL activation triggers potassium efflux and assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is required for the processing and activity of IL-1β released during necroptosis. Notably, MLKL activation also causes cell membrane disruption, which allows efficient release of IL-1β independently of the recently described pyroptotic effector gasdermin-D. Taken together, our findings indicate that MLKL is an endogenous activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and that MLKL activation provides a mechanism for concurrent processing and release of IL-1β independently of gasdermin-D.

> The NLRP3 inflammasome is the beststudied inflammasome and is minimally composed of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1.

> A wide array of stimuli has been shown to activate NLRP3, with disrupted ion homeostasis and potassium efflux recently proposed as a unifying stimulus. Inflammasome assembly leads to activation of caspase-1, which cleaves and activates the recently-identified cell death effector gasdermin-D (GSDMD) (4, 5). GSDMD forms pores in the cell membrane causing disruption of its integrity and triggering release of cytosolic proteins(6, 7). 
  **Pyroptosis is characterized by cellular swelling and rupture. Multiple stimuli activates NLRP3, this leeds to inflammasome assembly and CASP1 activation, following GSDMD cleaveage by CASP1. GSDMD forms pores that trigger cell execution in pyroptosis. In addtion to GSDMD, CASP1 promotes IL1b and IL18 cleavage and activation**

> Execution of the necroptotic program has also been associated with the processing of IL-1β through diverse mechanisms(12). These include production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)(13), altered mitochondrial dynamics(14), and death-independent, RIP kinase-mediated effects(15) leading to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as by direct processing of IL-1β by caspase-8 associated with the necrosome(16-19).

> Studies have also indicated that MLKL activation could promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation(16); however, this phenomenon has been difficult to characterize because experimental induction of necroptosis requires caspase inhibition, which in turn prevents NLRP3-mediated caspase-1 activation and the production of bioactive IL-1β.

> As expected, cells lacking caspase-1, but not those lacking RIPK3, were resistant to pyroptosis induced by the canonical NLRP3-activating stimulus of LPS priming followed by nigericin treatment (Fig. 1D). Similarly, cells lacking RIPK3, but not those lacking caspase-1, were resistant to necroptosis induced by treatment with the canonical necroptosis-activating stimulus, comprised of TNF-α, a caspase inhibitor (zVAD), and SMAC mimetic (BV6) (Fig. 1E).

> This indicates that MLKL-mediated membrane disruption can both activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and allow the release of processed IL-1β produced by this complex, independent of the effector GSDMD.

> Our findings are therefore consistent with the idea that MLKL acts as an endogenous toxin-like molecule and that MLKL-mediated membrane disruption and resultant necroptotic cell death triggers the same inflammasome-mediated pathway as bacterial toxin molecules. Notably, this effect is independent of GSDMD, which is required for efficient release of IL-1β during caspase-dependent pyroptosis.
