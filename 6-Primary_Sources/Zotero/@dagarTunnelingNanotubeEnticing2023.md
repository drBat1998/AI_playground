> The spread of disease-causing pathological proteins between neurons through TNTs can contribute to the propagation of disease across different brain areas [21,25]. Moreover, TNTs can facilitate the transmission of neurotoxic factors and detrimental signals like amyloid-β, reactive oxygen species (ROS), cholera toxin B, and apoptotic signals, exacerbating the progression of these disorders [7,26].

> Moreover, overloaded microglia can form TNTs, both in vitro and in vivo, to release excessive α-syn aggregates to neighboring microglia, which help in their clearance [55]. During such process, TNTs can prevent cell death and inflammation by transferring the mitochondria from naïve microglia to affected microglia [55]. Astrocytes and microglia can employ TNTs to facilitate the transfer of α-syn and mitochondria between astrocytes [7,56].

These studies indicate that glial–TNT communication plays a critical role in decreasing the burden of accumulated protein aggregates and in promoting the mitochondria-mediated rescue mechanisms in neurodegenerative disease [7,56].

[[tunneling nanotubes]]
Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are membranous cell-cell communication structures that consist primary with actin. TNTs give the ability to share organelles, proteins, and ions between cells. TNTs vary in both lifetimes and diameters. During pathological condition the TNTs may cause disease spreading through sharing pathological proteins (amyloid-b or α-syn), reactive oxygen species, cell death signals, or damaged organelles.
