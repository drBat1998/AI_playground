> The use of primary mammalian neurons derived from embryonic central nervous system tissue is limited by the fact that once terminally differentiated into mature neurons, the cells can no longer be propagated. Transformed neuronal-like cell lines can be used in vitro to overcome this limitation. However, several caveats exist when utilizing cells derived from malignant tumors. In this context, the popular SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and its use in in vitro systems is described. Originally derived from a metastatic bone tumor biopsy, SH-SY5Y (ATCC(®) CRL-2266™) cells are a subline of the parental line SK-N-SH (ATCC(®) HTB-11™). SK-N-SH were subcloned three times; first to SH-SY, then to SH-SY5, and finally to SH-SY5Y. SH-SY5Y were deposited to the ATCC(®) in 1970 by June L. Biedler.Three important characteristics of SH-SY5Y cells should be considered when using these cells in in vitro studies. First, cultures include both adherent and floating cells, both types of which are viable. Few studies address the biological significance of the adherent versus floating phenotypes, but most reported studies utilize adherent populations and discard the floating cells during media changes. Second, early studies by Biedler's group indicated that the parental differentiated SK-N-SH cells contained two morphologically distinct phenotypes: neuroblast-like cells and epithelial-like cells (Ross et al., J Nat Cancer Inst 71:741-747, 1983). These two phenotypes may correspond to the "N" and "S" types described in later studies in SH-SY5Y by Encinas et al. (J Neurochem 75:991-1003, 2000). Cells with neuroblast-like morphology are positive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-β-hydroxylase characteristic of catecholaminergic neurons, whereas the epithelial-like counterpart cells lacked these enzymatic activities (Ross et al., J Nat Cancer Inst 71:741-747, 1983). Third, SH-SY5Y cells can be differentiated to a more mature neuron-like phenotype that is characterized by neuronal markers. There are several methods to differentiate SH-SY5Y cells and are mentioned below. Retinoic acid is the most commonly used means for differentiation and will be addressed in detail.

> Hormones and neurotransmitters that upregulate intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) promote differentiation and long-term potentiation in neuronal cells [18, 19]. Exposure of SH-SY5Ycells to dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) results in neurite extension, as well as in increased expression of the mature neuronal marker growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) [19, 20].

> Numerous reports have specifically addressed methods to obtain neuron-like cells from undifferentiated SH-SY5Y. Some reports suggest using only floating cells in differentiation protocols, while others recommend using only adherent cells for differentiation. A detailed description for RA-differentiated, BDNF maintained SH-SY5Ycells was published in 2000 by Encinas et al. [2]. In these studies, the authors classify undifferentiated cells as either Stype (substrate adherent) without neuron-like phenotype or N-type (neuroblastic) characterized by neuritic processes (Fig. 3). In the study by Encinas, cells were plated at 104 cells/cm2 on collagen-coated (0.05 mg/ml) plates in DMEM with 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (20 IU/ml), streptomycin (20 mg/ml) and 15 % FBS. Upon differentiation with 10 μm all-trans-RA for 5 days, N-type cells were reported to gain neuron-like characteristics more readily than S-type. However, at day 10 post-RA, the percentage of S-type cells in the

> A treatment (up to 5 days) appeared to induce differentiation of N-type cells, but longer treatment (>10 days) promoted proliferation of S-type cells thereby promoting unbalanced proportion of S- to N-type cells. Based on results such as these, consideration should be given not only to passage number, but also to cell phenotype in culture when designing in vitro experiments. One potential solution to prevent the imbalance, recommended by Encinas et al. is adding 50 ng/ml BDNF to RA-treated cultures since RA is reported to induce TrkB receptors on SH-SY5Ycells with maximal expression 5 days after BDNF exposure. Removal of serum in combination with BDNF treatment is recommended to prevent replication of S-type cells. Including serum during RA-BDNF treatments can promote S-type proliferation that is observed as a monolayer of S cells under the differentiating N-type cells. Cultures maintained under serum-free, BDNF supplemented conditions were stable for up to 3 weeks without S-type cell over growth with minimal apoptotic cells as determined by TUNEL assay and biochemical analyses. With BDNF cells are arrested, but BDNF withdrawal induces cells to enter the S-phase of the cell cycle [2].
