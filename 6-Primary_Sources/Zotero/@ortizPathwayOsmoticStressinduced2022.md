> Using a genome-wide CRISPRCas9 screen, the researchers identified Slc9a1, which encodes Na+/H+ exchanger-1 (NHE1), as the only gene involved in osmotic stress-induced necroptosis that does not belong to the canonical necroptosis pathway.

> n cells cultured with high concentrations of NaCl or sucrose to increase osmolality, NHE1 increased cytosolic pH and promoted RIPK3 autophosphorylation and necroptosis, whereas pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 prevented osmotic stress-induced necroptosis.

> increased intracellular pH was sufficient to activate RIPK3. These findings identify a non-canonical pathway for RIPK3 activation and further increase the complexity of mechanisms known to drive necroptosis.

> However, deletion of the RHIM domain of RIPK3 did not affect osmotic stress-induced MLKL phosphorylation and necroptosis

> By contrast, deletion of 10 amino acids in the kinase domain of RIPK3 prevented MLKL phosphorylation in response to osmotic stress, identifying the kinase domain as essential for osmotic stress-induced necroptosis.

> In human induced pluripotent stem cells, overexpression of NHE1 and consequent cytosolic alkalization induced necrotic cell death through sustained activation of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), although the targets of ROCK were not identified3.
