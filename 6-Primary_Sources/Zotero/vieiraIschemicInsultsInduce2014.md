> Global cerebral ischemia induces selective acute neuronal injury of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The type of cell death that ensues may include  different programmed cell death mechanisms namely apoptosis and necroptosis, a  recently described type of programmed necrosis. We investigated whether  necroptosis contributes to hippocampal neuronal death following oxygen-glucose  deprivation (OGD), an in vitro model of global ischemia. We observed that OGD  induced a death receptor (DR)-dependent component of necroptotic cell death in  primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. Additionally, we found that this  ischemic challenge upregulated the receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3)  mRNA and protein levels, with a concomitant increase of the RIP1 protein.  Together, these two related proteins form the necrosome, the complex responsible  for induction of necroptotic cell death. Interestingly, we found that caspase-8  mRNA, a known negative regulator of necroptosis, was transiently decreased  following OGD. Importantly, we observed that the OGD-induced increase in the RIP3  protein was paralleled in an in vivo model of transient global cerebral ischemia,  specifically in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Moreover, we show that the  induction of endogenous RIP3 protein levels influenced neuronal toxicity since we  found that RIP3 knock-down (KD) abrogated the component of OGD-induced necrotic  neuronal death while RIP3 overexpression exacerbated neuronal death following  OGD. Overexpression of RIP1 also had deleterious effects following the OGD  challenge. Taken together, our results highlight that cerebral ischemia activates  transcriptional changes that lead to an increase in the endogenous RIP3 protein  level which might contribute to the formation of the necrosome complex and to the  subsequent component of necroptotic neuronal death that follows ischemic injury.

  **TNFR1 signaling consists of two main complexes. Complex I is associated with RIPK1 and NFkb activity and plays a role in inflammation. Complex II is associated with procaspase 8, RIPK1, and RIPK3. The activity of caspase 8 determines the cell's outcome. Deactivation of caspase 8 leads to necroptosis.**

  **Necrosome or complex IIb is cosist of RIPK1 and RIPK3**
