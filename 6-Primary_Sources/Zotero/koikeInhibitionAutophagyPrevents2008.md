> Neonatal hypoxic/ischemic (H/I) brain injury causes neurological impairment, including cognitive and motor dysfunction as well as seizures. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating neuron death after H/I injury are poorly defined and remain controversial. Here we show that Atg7, a gene essential for autophagy induction, is a critical mediator of H/I-induced neuron death. Neonatal mice subjected to H/I injury show dramatically increased autophagosome formation and extensive hippocampal neuron death that is regulated by both caspase-3-dependent and -independent execution. Mice deficient in Atg7 show nearly complete protection from both H/I-induced caspase-3 activation and neuron death indicating that Atg7 is critically positioned upstream of multiple neuronal death executioner pathways. Adult H/I brain injury also produces a significant increase in autophagy, but unlike neonatal H/I, neuron death is almost exclusively caspase-3-independent. These data suggest that autophagy plays an essential role in triggering neuronal death execution after H/I injury and Atg7 represents an attractive therapeutic target for minimizing the neurological deficits associated with H/I brain injury.

> Analysis of DNA Fragmentation  Genomic DNA was isolated according to a previously described method.40 Briefly, each tissue was separately homogenized gently in 1 ml of a lysis buffer consisting of 4 mol/L guanidine thiocyanate and 0.1 mol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Then, 20 l of QIAEX II suspension (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was added to each sample, and the samples were vortexed, incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and finally spun at 12,500 g for 2 minutes. The pellets were washed by resuspending them three times in a NEW Wash solution (GENECLEAN kit; Bio 101, Vista, CA) consisting of 50% ethanol, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris/HCl, and 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 7.5, followed by resuspension in a TE buffer consisting of 10 mmol/L Tris/HCl and 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 8.0. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes and spun at 12,500 g for 2 minutes. The supernatants were collected and stored at 30°C until used. To visualize DNA laddering in DNA samples from individual animals, a ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR) was performed with some modifications, as outlined.43,44 Briefly, two unphosphorylated oligonucleotides (24 bp, 5 -AGCACTCTCGAGCCTCTCACCGCA-3 ; 12 bp, 5 -TGCGGTGAGAGG-3 ) were synthesized (Invitrogen). These are DNA fragments that are never amplified from normal mouse brain DNA. The oligonucleotides were annealed by heating to 55°C for 10 minutes, and the mixture was allowed to cool to 10°C for 55 minutes in advance of the experiment. Genomic DNA (1.0 g) was mixed with 1 nmol each of the 24-bp and 12-bp unphosphorylated oligonucleotides in 50 l of T4 DNA ligase buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and 3 U of T4 DNA ligase (Promega). The mixture was incubated at 16°C overnight, and the samples were then diluted with TE to a final concentration of 5 ng/ l, and stored at 20°C until used for PCR. The 24-mer adaptor also served as a primer in the LMPCR (50 l volume), in which 25 ng of ligated DNA was amplified with reagents from the Expand high-fidelity PCR system (Roche) under the following conditions: hot start (72°C for 8 minutes) with 1.75 U Expand high-fidelity enzyme mix (TaqDNA polymerase and Tgo DNA polymerase) added after 3 minutes, 20 (neonate) or 25 (adult) cycles (94°C for 1 minute, 72°C for 3 minutes), and postcycling (72°C for 15 minutes). The amplified DNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel, visualized by staining with ethidium bromide, and photographed on a UV transilluminator (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

> The present study demonstrated that 
> 1) H/I injury-induced pyramidal neuron death in the neonatal hippocampus occurred in caspase 3-dependent and caspase 3-independent manners. The caspase 3-independent neuron death in this model was accompanied by DNA ladder formation that was mediated by an unknown DNase other than CAD. 
> 2) H/I injury induced autophagy in neonatal hippocampal pyramidal neurons, whereas this pyramidal neuron death was prevented by Atg7 deficiency. 
> 3) Pyramidal neuron death in the adult hippocampus after H/I injury was caspase-independent and accompanied by autophagosome formation.
