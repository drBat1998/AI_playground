> [!Abstract]
>
> A Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant in cell division cycle gene CDC48 shows typical markers of apoptosis: membrane staining with annexin V, indicating an exposure of phosphatidylserine at the outer layer of the cytoplasmic membrane; intense staining, using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling method, indicating DNA fragmentation; and chromatin condensation and fragmentation. The coordinate occurrence of these events at different locations in the cell, which have no obvious connection except their relation to apoptosis, implies the presence of the molecular machinery performing the basic steps of apoptosis already in yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae may prove a suitable model to trace the roots of apoptosis.

> Neither evidence of nuclear fragmentation nor of chromatin margination against the nuclear envelope, nor internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was observed. Jürgensmeier et al. (1997), therefore labeled the Bax-induced effect “cytotoxicity,” to distinguish it from apoptosis.

> We investigated a mutant of baker’s yeast in cell division cycle gene CDC48 for markers of apoptosis. Cdc48p plays an important role in the homotypic fusion of the endoplasmic reticulum; in vitro, Cdc48p is the only soluble protein necessary for the fusion of ER-derived vesicles (Latterich et al., 1995). A defect in CDC48 results in a cell cycle arrest as a large budded cell with the nucleus located in the neck between the mother and the daughter cell at 168C (Moir et al., 1982; Fröhlich et al., 1991).

> An aliquot of the protoblasts used for TUNEL staining was tested for integrity by incubation with 23 mg/ ml propidium iodide. Less than 3% of the protoplasts became stained, proving that the DNA fragmentation is not a result of cell necrosis.

> In mammals, exposition of phosphatidylserine serves as bait for macrophages that then deal with the disposal of the  apoptotic bodies (Fadok et al., 1992; Martin et al., 1995). Our observation in yeast indicates a more fundamental connection between phosphatidylserine exposure and other events of apoptosis. Therefore, the exposure probably has not been developed to attract macrophages, but rather phagocytic cells throughout evolution have learned to interpret the phenomenon as a signal of attraction.
