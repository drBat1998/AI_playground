> Necroptosis has an important role in ischemia-reperfusion damage. The expression of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is upregulated in neurons following  ischemia-reperfusion, however, whether HDAC6 is closely involved in the  necroptosis, which occurs during ischemia-reperfusion damage remains to be  elucidated. In the present study, the roles of HDAC6 in the necroptosis of  cultured rat cortical neurons were investigated in a oxygen-glucose deprivation  (OGD) model. The results demonstrated that OGD induced marked necroptosis of  cultured rat cortical neurons and upregulated the expression of HDAC6 in the  cultured neurons, compared with the control (P<0.05). The necroptosis inhibitor,  necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), decreased The expression of HDAC6 in the OGD-treated  cultured neurons, accompanied by the inhibition of necroptosis. Further  investigation revealed that, compared with OGD treatment alone, inhibiting the  activity of HDAC6 with tubacin, a specific HDAC6 inhibitor, reduced the  OGD-induced necroptosis of the cultured rat cortical neurons (P<0.05), which was  similar to the change following treatment with Nec-1 (P>0.05). In addition,  inhibiting the activity of HDAC6 reversed the OGD-induced increase of reactive  oxygen species (ROS) and the OGD-induced decrease of acetylated tubulin in the  cultured rat cortical neurons (P<0.05), compared with the neurons treated with  OGD alone). The levels of acetylated tubulin in the cultured neurons following  treatment with OGD and tubacin were significantly higher than those in the  control (P<0.05). These results suggested that HDAC6 was involved in the  necroptosis of neurons during ischemia-reperfusion by modulating the levels of  ROS and acetylated tubulin.

> Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a member of the class IIb histone deacetylases and is present predominantly in the cytosol (13,14). HDAC6 is expressed widely in the brain (15).

> Nuclear morphology. Neuronal death was assessed by analyzing the nuclear morphology 3 h after OGD. At this time-point, the neurons in each group were stained using the nuclear dye, PI (2 μg/ml), for 8 min at 37 ̊C. The neurons were then washed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma‐Aldrich), washed again with 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and covered with mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) and 4',6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Inc.). The PI staining and chromatin condensation of the neurons in each group

> were immediately analyzed under fluorescence microscopy (Nikon 80i; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). According to a method described by Vieira (11), ‘positive PI staining’ was considered a necrotic marker, since membrane leak is one of the predominant features of necrotic cell death (11). Chromatin condensation and pyknosis, revealed by the DAPI staining were referred to as apoptotic markers (11). Necrotic-like neuronal death was marked by positive PI staining (11). The percentages of necrotic cell death (PI‐positive cells / total number of cells) and of apoptotic‐like cell death (apoptotic‐like nuclei / total number of cells) were calculated.

> Similar results were also detected in cultured hippocampal neurons following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), an ischemia-reperfusion model (11). Inhibiting necroptosis significantly decreases the OGD‐induced loss of cultured hippocampal neurons (11), suggesting that necroptosis is important in ischemia-reperfusion damage.
