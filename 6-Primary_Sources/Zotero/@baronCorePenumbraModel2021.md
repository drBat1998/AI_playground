# Abstract 
Despite major advances in prevention, ischaemic stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. After centuries of nihilism and decades of failed neuroprotection trials, the discovery, initially in non-human primates and subsequently in man, that ischaemic brain tissue termed the ischaemic penumbra can be salvaged from infarction up to and perhaps beyond 24 h after stroke onset has underpinned the development of highly efficient reperfusion therapies, namely intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy, which have revolutionized the management of the acute stroke patient. Animal experiments have documented that how long the penumbra can survive depends not only on time elapsed since arterial occlusion ('time is brain'), but also on how severely perfusion is reduced. Novel imaging techniques allowing the penumbra and the already irreversibly damaged core in the individual subject to be mapped have documented that the time course of core growth at the expense of the penumbra widely differs from patient to patient, and hence that individual physiology should be considered in addition to time since stroke onset for decision-making. This concept has been implemented to optimize patient selection in pivotal trials of reperfusion therapies beyond 3 h after stroke onset and is now routinely applied in clinical practice, using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The notion that, in order to be both efficient and harmless, treatment should be tailored to each patient's physiological characteristics represents a radical move towards precision medicine.

> Epidemiology—global burden of stroke  Stroke poses an enormous challenge to health-care systems worldwide, but especially in LMICs (where 90% of all stroke-related deaths and disability occur, coupled with a surge in stroke incidence) compared with high-income countries.7 Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, with almost 7 million deaths worldwide, and is the third leading cause of disability. In 2019, there were over 100 million patients who had a stroke and 12 million new stroke cases globally. Both the incidence (6·4 million vs 5·8 million) and prevalence (56·4 million vs 45·0 million) of all strokes was higher in women than men.7 There are reports that this worrisome sex difference becomes even more pronounced as women might have poorer access to endovascular therapy and also have lower poststroke functional outcomes;8 however, there are still many knowledge gaps on the causes and interpretation of these sex differences. The global absolute incidence of stroke increased by 70% and the prevalence by 85% between 1990 and 2019.7 This increase was partly due to population growth and ageing.7 However, there is a concern over the increasing age standardised incidence of ischaemic stroke in people between 18 and 50 years, which increased by 50% over the last decade.9 Possible explanations for the increased incidence in stroke in young patients are two-fold. First, advanced neuroimaging techniques, particularly diffusion-weighted MRI, might simply result in better stroke detection and more sensitive diagnosis, reducing the risk of misclassification. Second, there is an increased prevalence of modifiable traditional vascular risk factors among young people, such as obesity, diabetes, and increased use of illicit and recreational drugs worldwide, which is a known cause of stroke.10 The yearly incidence of ischaemic stroke varies between less than 41 per 100 000 people in HICs to more than 150 per 100 000 in LMICs; for intracerebral haemorrhage thesefiguresarelessthan15per100 000peopleinHICsand over 97 per 100 000 people in LMICs.7 Major contributors to stroke in LMICs are the high prevalence of vascular risk factors such as (uncontrolled) hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking, poor diet, and lack of physical exercise as well as poor access to primary care facilities or general practitioners. However, reliable data on the epidemiology of stroke in LMICs are scarce. As most strokes occur in these countries, investigating causes and both short-term and long-term consequences of stroke should be a priority for future research. Over 90% of all ischaemic strokes are attributed to these treatable and preventable risk factors.11 Apart from these conventional vascular risks, it has become increasingly clear that environmental factors such as lead exposure, ambient air pollution (more serious in LMICs than in the HICs), and extremes of atmospheric temperature7 are also important risks for stroke. Evidence suggests an escalated risk for stroke after short-term (days) and long-term (years) exposure to air pollution.

> Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase or tenecteplase Alteplase is currently the only thrombolytic agent approved by all regulatory agencies for acute ischaemic strokes.41,42 Upon exclusion of intracerebral haemorrhage by non-contrast brain CT, alteplase at 0·9 mg per kg (10% bolus followed by 90% infused in 1 h; maximum 90 mg) reduced stroke-related disability.43 Current guidelines recommend intravenous thrombolysis within 4·5 h after stroke onset, and the number needed to treat for intravenous thrombolysis to achieve one additional patient with excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0–1) is time-dependent; 10 within 3 h after stoke onset, and 19 from 3–4·5 h.44,45 The absolute risk of fatal intracerebral haemorrhage was

> approximately 2%.46 The benefit of alteplase was less clear in patients with non-disabling stroke symptoms.47,48 Tenecteplase is a genetically modified variant of alteplase that allows intravenous thrombolysis in a single bolus in seconds without subsequent infusion. Although tenecteplase is currently only approved for acute myocardial infarction by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it has been frequently used offlabel in acute ischaemic strokes.41 For patients who have had an ischaemic stroke with a duration of less than 4·5 h who are eligible for intravenous thrombolysis, tenecteplase 0·25 mg per kg (maximum 25 mg) is now considered as a safe and effective alternative to alteplase 0·9 mg per kg.49–55 The rate of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage of tenecteplase at 0·25 mg per kg was comparable to alteplase 0·9 mg per kg. In prehospital thrombolysis by a mobile stroke unit, tenecteplase 0·25 mg per kg for patients with ischaemic stroke with a duration of less than 4·5 h enhanced early reperfusion rate.56 For patients with acute large vessel occlusion stroke of with a duration of less than 4·5 h who are eligible for both intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy, tenecteplase 0·25 mg per kg (maximum 25 mg) enhanced recanalisation rates before and at the end of the endovascular thrombectomy.49,50,57,58 However, it was not associated with better functional outcome at 90 days in patients with wake-up stroke selected by non-contrast CT.59

> Intravenous thrombolysis in extended time-window  In general, infarct core progresses with time from stroke onset, but the pace of progression varies among patients. Therefore, ideally an individual tissue clock rather than a fixed time window should determine eligibility of reperfusion therapies. Advanced imaging (CT or MRI perfusion) could act as such a clock and was used to identify patients with salvageable brain tissue 9 h from symptom recognition.60,61 This subset of patients had as much benefit from intravenous thrombolysis, with similar risk of fatal intracerebral haemorrhage, as did those treated within 3 h from stroke onset. Alternatively, if patients with unknown stroke onset time (or wake-up stroke) had diffuse-weighted imaging-positive lesions indicative of acute ischaemia that were not yet hyperintense on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence (eg, diffuse-weighted imaging–FLAIR mismatch), the stroke onset was likely to be within 4·5 h, and they might benefit from alteplase.62 However, the constrained MRI service in many regions might reduce the applicability of this technique.

> Endovascular thrombectomy and acute stroke treatment  In 2015, endovascular thrombectomy was shown to reduce disability and mortality for ischaemic strokes attributed to acute large vessel occlusion.63–68 The number of patients needed to treat to reduce disability by at least  one level on the mRS for one patient was 2·6; patients younger than 80 years and those not qualifying for intravenous thrombolysis also benefit from endovascular thrombectomy.68 The treatment window of endovascular thrombectomy has been extended to 24 h from symptom onset on the basis of imaging evidence of salvageable brain tissue69,70 or collateral flow.71,72 In a meta-analysis of endovascular thrombectomy trials using a 6–24 h window, endovascular thrombectomy was associated with higher rates of independent daily living (mRS 0–2) without increasing intracerebral haemorrhage or mortality compared to medical treatment, and while there was no heterogeneity of treatment effect noted across subgroups defined by age, gender, baseline stroke severity, vessel occlusion site, baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, or mode of presentation, treatment effect was stronger in patients randomly assigned within 12–24 h than those randomly assigned within 6–12 h.72 Although patients with large vessel occlusion and large core infarcts were excluded in early trials, randomised studies have found meaningful clinical benefits of endovascular thrombectomy in this subgroup of patients.73–76 A pooled analysis showed that compared with medical therapy alone, endovascular thrombectomy for patients with extensive ischaemic injury selected on non-contrast CT, CT perfusion, or MRI was associated with a higher likelihood of reduced disability, independent ambulation, and good functional outcome at 3 months.77 In practice, treatment decisions for patients with large core infarcts need to be individualised and consider patients’ comorbidities. Figure 3 depicts large vessel occlusion, salvageable brain tissue, and restoration of cerebral blood flow after endovascular thrombectomy. For posterior circulation large vessel occlusion, two studies have shown improved functional outcomes at 90 days in patients with basilar artery occlusion with endovascular thrombectomy compared with medical treatment, although endovascular thrombectomy was associated with procedural complications and intracerebral haemorrhage.78,79 A meta-analysis suggested the overall benefit of endovascular thrombectomy in acute basilar artery occlusion up to 24 h.80 However, the treatment benefit in individuals with basilar artery occlusion with milder deficits (NIHSS <10) remained uncertain. Although stroke guidelines emphasise that intravenous thrombolysis should not delay endovascular thrombectomy, there is no strong evidence that intravenous thrombolysis should be skipped in patients with large vessel occlusion.81–86 Therefore, for stroke patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who are admitted directly to a centre capable of endovascular thrombectomy within 4·5 h of symptom onset and who are eligible for both treatments, current guidelines recommend both intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy. In stroke patients with

> anterior circulation large vessel occlusion admitted to a primary stroke centre and eligible for intravenous thrombolysis (symptom onset ≤4·5 h) and endovascular thrombectomy, guidelines recommend intravenous thrombolysis followed by rapid transfer to endovascular thrombectomy-capable centres. During postendovascular thrombectomy care, intensive control of systolic blood pressure to lower than 120 mm Hg should be avoided to prevent compromising the patients’ functional recovery.87,88
