> Myocardial ischemia‒reperfusion (I/R) injury is the primary factor that counteracts the beneficial effects of reperfusion therapy. Cardiomyocyte death serves as the fundamental pathological hallmark of I/R injury. However, targeting a single type of cell death has been reported to be ineffective at preventing I/R injury. ZBP1 is well established as a nucleic acid sensor that activates inflammatory and various cell death signaling pathways. However, the specific role of ZBP1 in adult cardiomyocytes, particularly in the absence of nucleic acid ligands, remains largely unexplored. In this study, our dynamic transcriptomic analyses at various I/R stages revealed a cluster of genes significantly enriched in cell death-related processes, with ZBP1 showing significant expression changes in both our I/R injury mouse model and public human ischemic cardiomyopathy datasets. Cardiomyocytes are the primary cell type expressing ZBP1 in response to I/R injury. Hypoxia/reoxygenation stress induced the upregulation of multiple cell death markers indicative of PANoptosis in adult cardiomyocytes, which was mitigated by ZBP1 deficiency. Compared with treatment with conventional cell death inhibitors, cardiomyocyte-specific Zbp1 deficiency ameliorated I/R-induced PANoptosis, resulting in a more substantial reduction in myocardial infarct size. Conversely, myocardial Zbp1 overexpression in adult mice directly induced cardiac remodeling and heart failure. Mechanistically, ZBP1 drives cardiomyocyte PANoptosis by promoting the formation of the ZBP1/RIPK3/CAS8/CAS6 PANoptosome complex. Virtual screening and experimental validation revealed a novel small-molecule compound, MSB, which has high binding affinity for ZBP1 and effectively attenuates myocardial I/R injury both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these findings highlight the role of ZBP1 as a mediator of cardiomyocyte PANoptosis and suggest that targeting ZBP1 could be a promising strategy for mitigating myocardial I/R injury.

> The RHIM  domains enable ZBP1 to interact with RIPK1 and RIPK3.11 The ZBP1/RIPK1 complex reportedly transduces NF-κB signaling during  microbial infections,19 whereas the ZBP1/RIPK3 complex recruits other components necessary for PANoptosome assembly.20,34 Here, we demonstrated that ZBP1, RIPK3, CASP8, and CASP6 interact to form a PANoptosome and that some canonical components, such as RIPK1, NLRP3, and ASC, are dispensable for the formation of this ZBP1-derived PANoptosome in cardiomyocytes. These findings can be attributed to the distinct expression patterns of canonical inflammasome components in cardiomyocytes compared with those in other cell types, resulting in a simpler PANoptosome in cardiomyocytes than in immune cells. 


[[ZBP1 induces PANoptosis-like cell death in cardiomyocytes during ischemia]]
Ischemia induces PANoptosis-like cell death in cardiomyocytes via ZBP1 receptor. Interesting that the authors claim that the PANoptosis is cardiomyocyte-specific and does not include several canonical PANoptosis components, such as RIPK1, NLRP3, and ASC.
