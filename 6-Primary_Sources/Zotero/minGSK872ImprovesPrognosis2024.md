> BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important health concern in the society. Previous studies have suggested that necroptosis occurs following TBI. However, the underlying mechanisms and roles of necroptosis are not well understood. In this study, we aimed to assess the role of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIP3)-mediated necroptosis after TBI both in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: We established a cell-stretching injury and mouse TBI model by applying a cell injury controller and controlled cortical impactor to evaluate the relationships among necroptosis, apotosis, inflammation, and TBI both in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: The results revealed that necroptosis mediated by RIP1, RIP3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein was involved in secondary TBI. Additionally, protein kinase B (Akt), phosphorylated Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and phosphorylated mTOR potentially contribute to necroptosis. The inhibition of RIP3 by GSK'872 (a specific inhibitor) blocked necroptosis and reduced the activity of Akt/mTOR, leading to the alleviation of inflammation by reducing the levels of NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3. Moreover, the inhibition of RIP3 by GSK'872 promoted the activity of cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-8, an enzyme involved in apoptosis and inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that RIP3 inhibition could improve the prognosis of TBI, based on the attenuation of inflammation by switching RIP3-dependent necroptosis to cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-8-dependent apoptosis.

> Akt is known to be a critical mediator of growth factor-induced neuronal survival in the developing nervous system, and mTOR is a downstream effector of Akt that mediates cellular response to stresses in neurological diseases, such as hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injuries.53,54 Previous studies reported that dual inhibition of Akt and mTOR reduced acute cell death post-CCI in mice,55 and the activation of the Akt/mTOR cascade following hypoxic or TBIs could trigger excitotoxicity, inflammation, and activation of cell death programs,56 suggesting that Akt/mTOR might participate in necroptosis involved in the pathologic process of traumatic brain cell death.31,55 In this study, we found that TBI induced phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR. These phosphorylation events were inhibited by GSK’872 both in vitro and in vivo (Figures 3B and  4B), suggesting that Akt/mTOR signaling may be regulated by RIP3 and may participate in necroptosis in neurons after TBI. It has been reported that Akt/mTOR is regulated by RIP1 and participates in necroptosis by inducing ROS.31 In this study, the inhibition of RIP3 also blocked the activity of Akt/mTOR, indicating that Akt/mTOR might be regulated by RIP3 (Figure 6). The inhibition of apoptosis is necessary for necroptosis. The Akt/mTOR pathway occasionally inhibits apoptosis. Akt/mTOR activation may participate in necroptosis via both apoptosis inhibition and ROS induction (Figure 6).
