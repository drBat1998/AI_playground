> Liver ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the obstacles in liver surgery such as liver resection and transplantation. In this study, we investigated the preventive effect on mouse liver IRI by feeding mice with inulin, which is a heterogeneous blend of indigestible fructose polymer. Mice were fed either a control ordinary diet (CD) or an inulin diet (ID) containing 5% inulin in the CD, for 14 days before the ischemia and reperfusion (IR) maneuver. IR induced-liver damages were significantly ameliorated in the ID group, compared with those in the CD group. Feeding mice with an ID, but not a CD, elevated levels of Bacteroidetes among gut microbiota, and especially increased Bacteroides acidifaciens in mouse feces, which resulted in significant elevation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the portal vein of mice. Among SCFAs, propionic acid (PA) was most significantly increased. The microbial gene functions related to PA biosynthesis were much higher in the fecal microbiome of the ID group compared to the CD. However, the action of PA on liver IRI has not been yet clarified. Direct intraperitoneal administration of PA alone prior to the ischemia strongly suppressed liver cell damages as well as inflammatory responses caused by liver IR. Furthermore, PA suppressed the secretion of inflammatory cytokines from peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro through TLR-4 with high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB-1), known to be released from apoptotic liver cells during the IR insult. The present study shows that PA may play a key role in the inulin-induced amelioration of mouse liver IRI.

  **Inulin is dietary fiber that can not be absorbed by the human intestinum, and only digest by gut microbioma into SCFAs.**

> The effects of SCFAs, such as butyric acid, propionic acid (PA), and valeric acid, have been reported to show a negative correlation with the immunostimulatory M1 macrophages, but a positive correlation with the immunoinhibitory M2 macrophages (15).

>1. The propionic acid has protective effects during ischemia in the liver begin with 1 mM to 10 mM.
>2. The propionic acids decrease the amount of HMGB1, this information suggests that it inhibits necrosis or necosis-like RCD.
>3. The SCFAs in general and propionic acid in particular influence inflammation in a minimal way through TLR4/NF-kb and p38 pathways.**
