> In this review I summarize interrelations between bioenergetic processes and such programmed death phenomena as cell suicide (apoptosis and necrosis) and mitochondrial suicide (mitoptosis). The following conclusions are made. (I) ATP and rather often mitochondrial hyperpolarization (i.e. an increase in membrane potential, delta psi) are required for certain steps of apoptosis and necrosis. (II) Apoptosis, even if it is accompanied by delta psi and [ATP] increases at its early stage, finally results in a delta psi collapse and ATP decrease. (III) Moderate (about three-fold) lowering of [ATP] for short and long periods of time induces apoptosis and necrosis, respectively. In some types of apoptosis and necrosis, the cell death is mediated by a delta psi-dependent overproduction of ROS by the initial (Complex I) and the middle (Complex III) spans of the respiratory chain. ROS initiate mitoptosis which is postulated to rid the intracellular population of mitochondria from those that are ROS overproducing. Massive mitoptosis can result in cell death due to release to cytosol of the cell death proteins normally hidden in the mitochondrial intermembrane space.

> ATP, or better dATP, proved to be a cofactor in formation of Apaf-1-cytochrome c complex (the apoptosome) carrying out conversion of inactive procaspase 9 into active caspase 9, an obligatory step in cytochrome c-dependent apoptosis.12,13 Moreover, those steps of apoptosis that are mediated by protein kinases depend by definition upon ATP, which is used as the phosphoryl donor for phosphorylation of some proteins involved in apoptosis (for reviews, see14,15).

> Intracellular migration of mitochondria represents another apoptosis-linked ATP-dependent process. It was reported that several types of apoptosis (in particular, the TNF-induced one) are accompanied with decomposition of extended mitochondrial profiles to small roundish mitochondria (“the thread-grain transition”).24 In many cases of apoptosis, such a transition was shown to be required for the cell death.25,26 The roundish mitochondria were shown to move from the cell periphery to the nucleus (for refs., see 26,27)

> This stops the kinesin-driven movement of mitochondria to the cell periphery and results in their translocation to the nucleus since dynein, i.e. ATPase responsible for mitochondrial movement in the opposite direction, remains active.28 To realize all these events, ATP is required at protein kinase steps and as the energy source for dynein-mediated movement of organelles. It is significant that the thread–grain transition precedes release of cytochrome c and other proteins from mitochondria. This means that such a transition followed by translocation of mitochondria to the nucleus might be regarded as a way to deliver these proteins to the nucleus where final apoptotic events take place. In certain cases, appearance of mitochondria inside the nucleus has been described.24

> In conclusion of this section, it should be stressed that the source of ATP required for apoptosis to proceed is not critical. It can be respiratory as well as glycolytic phosphorylation.9

> This means that transient lowering of ATP concentration is recognized by the cell as an apoptotic signal. Interestingly, lowering of the [ATP] by 1/3 does not induce cell death,64 whereas transient more than 97% decrease in [ATP]65,66 or its three-fold lowering for a longer period of time (5 h instead of 3 h)64 gave rise to necrosis (Figure 4).

> Moreover, the very fact that necrosis requires small but measurable ATP level (see, e.g., ref.11) also points to the conclusion that necrosis is, like apoptosis, programmed.

[[Why CASP8 inhibited during OGD-necroptosis?]]
Cell death mode is highly reliant on the level of energy inside the particular cell. Apoptosis is extremely hungry for energy, compared to the necrosis-related programmed cell death. 

[[mitochondria during necroptosis]]
Also, the mitochondrial membrane permeability is a classic component of apoptosis; this permeability may be temporary and occur particularly inside the outer membrane, where transition in the mitochondrial permeability is a key component of necrosis. 

Mitochondria during apoptosis migrate toward the nucleus


## 1. **ATP is the switch that chooses the death pathway**

Skulachev state that ATP is the the switch that chooses the death pathway:
- **Mild ATP drop (~3× down): apoptosis**
- **Severe ATP drop (97% down): necrosis**
- **Long moderate drop (≥5 h): necrosis**
- **No ATP? No apoptosis.**


## 2. **Apoptosis is _ATP-hungry_**

Skulachev hammers the point:
- Apoptosome assembly requires **ATP or dATP**.
- Protein kinases (c-Jun, MAPK, PKC, all of them) need ATP.
- Mitochondrial fission (“thread–grain transition”) needs ATP for kinesin and dynein.
- Transport of mitochondria toward the nucleus is ATP-dependent and happens _before_ cytochrome c release.
This reinforces your previous reading:  
**MOMP does not instantly kill energy production**, and mitochondria remain dynamic.
