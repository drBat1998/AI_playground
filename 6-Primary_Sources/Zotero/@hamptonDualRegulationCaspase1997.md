> The induction of apoptosis in Jurkat T-lymphocytes with 50 μM hydrogen peroxide was associated with caspase activation. Caspase activity was first detected 3 h after treatment, and the morphological features of apoptosis were apparent by 6 h. At higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide there was no detectable caspase activity, and the cells died by necrosis. Cells treated with hydrogen peroxide were impaired in their ability to undergo Fas-mediated apoptosis. This appeared to be the result of direct inhibition of the cysteine-dependent caspases. The cells were able to recover and undergo apoptosis at later times. Therefore, hydrogen peroxide has two distinct effects. It initially inhibits the caspases and delays apoptosis. Then, depending on the degree of the initial oxidative stress, the caspases are activated and the cells die by apoptosis, or they remain inactive and necrosis occurs. We discuss the physiological implications of cells having to maintain a reducing environment during apoptosis to allow the caspases to function.

> Caspase activity in the hydrogen peroxide-treated cells was measured using DEVD peptide conjugated to the fluorophore AMC [4]. At 50 μΜ hydrogen peroxide there was a 10-fold increase in the rate of DEVD-AMC cleavage compared to control cells. Cleavage was inhibited by addition of DEVDCHO to the wells, indicating that it was specific for caspases (not shown) [4]. Optimal caspase activation occurred at 50 μΜ hydrogen peroxide, followed by a decline in activity at higher concentrations (Fig. ID). Above 200 μΜ, caspase activity dropped below the background activity seen in control cells. There was a 25% decrease in the ability of the cells to exclude trypan blue at 500 μΜ (Fig. ID), and these necrotic cells could also be detected by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C).

> As high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide appeared to inhibit the caspases, and activating concentrations only did so hours after consumption of the initial trigger, we were interested in the ability of the cells to respond to other apoptotic triggers at the same time as being treated with apoptosis-inducing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide.
