> 3D cell culture models have been developed to better mimic the physiological environments that exist in human diseases. As such, these models are advantageous over traditional 2D cultures for screening drug compounds. However, the practicalities of transitioning from 2D to 3D drug treatment studies pose challenges with respect to analysis methods. Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) possess unique features given their heterogeneity in size, shape, and growth patterns. A detailed assessment of the length scale at which PDTOs should be evaluated (i.e., individual cell or organoid-level analysis) has not been done to our knowledge. Therefore, using dynamic confocal live cell imaging and data analysis methods we examined tumor cell growth rates and drug response behaviors in colorectal cancer (CRC) PDTOs. High-resolution imaging of H2B-GFP-labeled organoids with DRAQ7 vital dye permitted tracking of cellular changes, such as cell birth and death events, in individual organoids. From these same images, we measured morphological features of the 3D objects, including volume, sphericity, and ellipticity. Sphericity and ellipticity were used to evaluate intra- and interpatient tumor organoid heterogeneity. We found a strong correlation between organoid live cell number and volume. Linear growth rate calculations based on volume or live cell counts were used to determine differential responses to therapeutic interventions. We showed that this approach can detect different types of drug effects (cytotoxic vs cytostatic) in PDTO cultures. Overall, our imaging-based quantification workflow results in multiple parameters that can provide patient- and drug-specific information for screening applications.

> Confocal 3D Live Cell Imaging and Quantitative Image Analysis of Organoids  Time-lapse 3D live cell imaging of H2B-GFP organoids was performed using the Olympus FV3000 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a TokaiHit stage-top incubation system to maintain environmental conditions (37 °C and 5% CO2). For static time point imaging, the same organoids were imaged at days 0, 1, 3, and 6 with ST, IR, and FU treatments. SN-38-treated organoids were imaged at days 0, 2, 4, and 7. Tile imaging (2 × 2) with a 10× objective was performed to image the center of each well. GFP (488 nm), DRAQ7 (640 nm), and brightfield (transmitted light) channels were captured with every 5 μm Z step for 800 μm (160 sections). Tile images were stitched to generate a single image file. Olympus image files (.oir) were converted to Imaris file format (.ims) using an Imaris file converter. The same matched area (750 × 750 μm) was cropped and each time point file was added to generate a single time-lapse imaging file. In Imaris, surface rendering was used to detect all organoids and calculate volume based on how much 3D  space an organoid object occupies (Organoid surface). Live cell spots were made from H2B-GFP signals to locate individual cell nuclei. Dead cell spots were generated with DRAQ7-stained cells. Colocalization spots were made to calculate the number of true live cells in organoids by subtracting the number of colocalized spots from the GFP-only counts. Organoid surface and spot information was imported to Imaris cell module to track individual organoids with live and dead spot numbers. Organoid 3D volume, surface area, and live and dead cell numbers in tracked organoids were exported from Imaris as Excel data sheets. Measurements of organoid sphericity and two different ellipticities, oblate and prolate, were also exported as morphological features. A
