> Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) significantly exacerbates neuronal damage following ischemic stroke. Emerging evidence implicates PANoptosis, a novel inflammatory form of programmed cell death, in CIRI pathogenesis. However, the role of Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (Zbp1), a key regulator of PANoptosis and innate immune responses, remains poorly understood in this context. Here, we establish a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) mouse model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) model in which HT-22 cells are used to simulate CIRI and investigate the effects of Zpb1. Western blot analysis is performed to assess Zbp1 and PANoptosis-related protein expressions. Cell viability and death are evaluated using Hoechst 33342 staining and Calcein AM/PI assays, and the cerebral infarct volume is quantified using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identify Ripk3 as a potential downstream effector of Zbp1. Furthermore, Zbp1 and PANoptosis-related proteins are significantly upregulated following OGD/R treatment. Zbp1 knockdown markedly reduces PANoptosis and cell injury in both models, decreases infarct volume and improves neurological outcomes in MCAO/R model mice. Conversely, Zbp1 overexpression exacerbates OGD/R-induced neuronal injury and PANoptosis in HT-22 cells. This effect is partially reversed by Ripk3 knockdown, indicating that Ripk3 mediates Zbp1-induced neuronal damage. These findings highlight Zbp1 as a promising therapeutic target in ischemic stroke and underscore the need for further research into Zbp1-mediated PANoptotic pathways to aid in the development of novel neuroprotective strategies.

> Western blot analysis revealed increased Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-7 levels, with no changes in total caspase-3 or caspase-7 levels, indicating the induction of apoptosis (Figure 1B,C). The upregulation of phosphorylated Ripk3 (p-Ripk3), phosphorylated Mlkl (p-Mlkl), Ripk3, and Mlkl expressions indicated necroptosis (Figure 1B,C). The expression of Gsdmd, a pyroptosis driver, was also upregulated (Figure 1B,C), suggesting that PANoptosis was induced. Hoechst 33342 staining revealed significant cell death (Figure 1D),

[[ZBP1 necroptosis]]
[[ZBP1 PANoptosis]]
Ischemic injury in hippocampal cells and in the MCAO/R model in mice simultaneously induces several cell death pathways, pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, also called PANoptosis via ZBP1. Increasing or decreasing the expression of ZBP1 inside the models changes the level of damage and the level of key executors of the pathways, respectively.[[@shuTargetingZbp1Ripk3Axis2025]]
