> Mixed lineage kinase like protein (MLKL) is a key mediator of necroptosis. While previous studies highlighted the important role of MLKL as one of the central  regulators of brain damage against acute ischemic neuronal injury, how the  activation of MLKL mediates brain injuries and cell death remains unclear,  especially in astrocytes. In a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)  rat model in vivo, and an oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/Re)  injury model in both primary cultured astrocytes and human astrocytes, we show  that necrosulfonamide (NSA), a MLKL specific inhibitor, reduces infarction volume  and improves neurological deficits in tMCAO-treated rats. In addition, NSA  treatment, as well as RIP1K inhibitor Nec-1 or RIP3K inhibitor GSK-872 treatment,  decreases the OGD/Re-induced leakage of LDH in both primary cultured astrocytes  and human astrocytes. NSA treatment also reduces the number of propidium iodide  (PI)-positive cells, and prevents the upregulation of necroptotic biomarkers such  as MLKL/p-MLKL, RIP3K/p-RIP3K, and RIP1K/p-RIP1K in ischemic penumbra of cerebral  cortex in tMCAO-treated rats or in OGD/Re-treated human astrocytes. Importantly,  NSA treatment blocks both the nucleus and nuclear envelope localization of  MLKL/p-MLKL and RIP3K/p-RIP3K in ischemic cerebral cortex induced by tMCAO.  Similarly, Co-immunoprecipitation assay shows that NSA treatment decreases tMCAO-  or OGD/Re- induced increased combination of MLKL and RIP3K in nuclear envelope of  ischemic penumbra of cerebral cortex or of primary cultured astrocytes,  respectively. RIP3K inhibitor GSK-872 also reduces tMCAO-induced increased  combination of MLKL and RIP3K in nuclear envelope of ischemic penumbra of  cerebral cortex. These data suggest NSA exerts protective effects against focal  ischemia/reperfusion injury via inhibiting astrocytic necroptosis through  preventing the upregulation of necroptotic kinases as well as blocking both the  nucleus and nuclear envelope co-localization of p-MLKL and p-RIP3K. The  translocation of p-MLKL, along with p-RIP3K, to the nuclear envelope and the  nucleus may play a crucial role in MLKL-mediated necroptosis under ischemic  conditions.

> Necroptosis can be triggered by the activation of death receptors such as TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). Once activated, TNFR1 recruits TNFR1-associated death domain (TRADD), TNFRassociated factor 2/5 (TRAF2/5), receptor-interacting kinase 1 (RIP1K), cellular inhibitors of apoptosis (cIAPs) and linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) to form complex I. Once de-ubiquitinated by de-ubiquitinating enzyme CYLD or A20, RIP1K dissociates from complex I and forms complex IIa with TRADD, fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) and caspase-8, inducing RIP1K-independent apoptosis. 
  **CYLD is RIPK2 deubiquitinating enzyme**

> Nuclear envelope protein extraction  Nuclear envelope protein extraction was performed using Minute Nuclear Envelope Protein Extraction Kit (NE-013, Invent Biotechnologies) following manufacturer’s instructions. After OGD/Re, human astrocytes or tissue from peri-infarct region were collected by low speed centrifugation. The supernatant was removed completely and the pellet was incubated with buffer A for 10 min. Following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 s, the filter was discarded and the supernatant was removed. Then the tubes were incubated with buffer B for 10 min and then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes. Following the addition of PBS, the tubes were inverted 10 times and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was stored.

  **MLKL and RIPK3 in nucleus somehow promotes cell death?**

> It is reported that activated MLKL reversely enhance activation of RIP1K and RIP3K and expressional upregulation of CYLD via improvement of intracellular ROS (Ding et al., 2019). The specific mechanism is still to be studied.
