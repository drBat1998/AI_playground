> During ischemia or inflammation of organs, intracellular pH can decrease if acid production exceeds buffering capacity. Thus, the microenvironment can expose parenchymal cells to a reduced extracellular pH which can alter pH-dependent intracellular functions. We have previously shown that while silencing caspase-8 in an in vivo ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) model results in improved organ function and survival, removal of caspase-8 function in a donor organ can paradoxically result in enhanced receptor-interacting protein kinase 1/3- (RIPK1/3-) regulated necroptosis and accelerated graft loss following transplantation. In our current study, TRAIL- (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-) induced cell death in vitro at neutral pH and caspase-8 inhibition-enhanced RIPK1-dependent necroptotic death were confirmed. In contrast, both caspase-8 inhibition and RIPK1 inhibition attenuated cell death at a cell pH of 6.7. Cell death was attenuated with mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) silencing, indicating that MLKL membrane rupture, a distinctive feature of necroptosis, occurs regardless of pH. In summary, there is a distinct regulatory control of apoptosis and necroptosis in endothelial cells at different intracellular pH. These results highlight the complexity of modulating cell death and therapeutic strategies that may need to consider different consequences on cell death dependent on the model.

> We had previously noted that inhibition of caspase-8 yields a benefit during IRI. Caspase-8 silencing in a renal IRI model provided injury protection and improved short-term survival [28, 29]. As organ injury has been shown to improve by targeting apoptosis cell death [28, 29, 43–46], we noted that caspase-8 silencing by siRNA in a kidney allograft model did not have an expected benefit and indeed resulted in massive in vivo necrosis and accelerated graft rejection [30].

> Our findings provide an important new insight into our observation that caspase-8 inhibition can play a protective role during IRI related to a low intracellular pH and microenvironment, while paradoxically becoming proinflammatory within transplantation in a normal pH environment.

> A recent study has shown that acidosis-induced necroptosis in neurons is dependent on acid-sensing ion channel 1a- (ASIC1a-) mediated RIPK1 phosphorylation [69]. Acid-sensing ASIC1a mediation of RIPK activation may thus explain how RIPKs are activated even in the presence of caspase-8 during acidosis. A previous study also showed that RIPK1 is cleaved at normal pH but not cleaved at acidic pH in tumor cells [12]. While these results might explain why RIPK1 can induce necroptosis despite in the presence of caspase-8 activity [11, 12], our data showed that RIPK1 is partially cleaved at normal and acidic pH conditions (Figure 4). This indicates caspase-8mediated RIPK1 cleavage at pH 7.4 is not altered when pH drops to acidic condition. It is likely that TRAIL induces apoptosis and necroptosis simultaneously at acidic pH in MVEC, as RIPK1 is only partially cleaved (Figure 4) and the inhibition of either caspase-8 or RIPK1 could attenuate acidonecrosis (Figures 2 and 3).
