> Acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by renal ischemia is a common clinical problem associated with a high morbidity and mortality. The present study investigated whether necroptosis was present in an in vitro renal ischemia model and whether the addition of necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) has a protective effect. In addition, whether autophagy was inhibited following the use of Nec-1 was also examined. When apoptosis was inhibited by z-VAD-fmk and energy was depleted with antimycin A for 1 h, the morphological abnormalities of human proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells were markedly attenuated, and the cell viability was significantly improved following incubation with Nec-1. LC3-II/I ratios and LC3-II/GAPDH ratios demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the Nec-1 + tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α + z-VAD-fmk + antimycin A (1 h) group compared with the control group. In conclusion, the present study suggested that necroptosis was present in HK-2 cells subjected to TNF-α stimulation and energy depletion. Nec-1 inhibits a caspase-independent necroptotic pathway involving autophagy and may have therapeutic potential to prevent and treat renal ischemic injury.

> antimycin A 
  **Antimycin A is inhibitor of electron transport chain that decrease ATP level in the absence of glucose. If glucose present cell undergo anaerobic glycolysis in order to obtain ATP.**

> In the present study, it was noted that Nec-1 pretreatment did not increase cell viability when HK-2 cells were subjected to ATP-depleted ischemic injury for 2 h. This indicated that necroptosis had an early onset and thus drug interventions targeting the mechanisms of necroptosis need to be used as early as possible. 


Liang et al. (2013) state that necroptosis plays an important role during ATP depletion in renal epithelial cells. The data show that, in the context of necroptosis induction (TNF + zVAD), autophagy is somehow emerging (LC3/GABDH ratio increase) and reduced if a RIPK1 inhibitor had been added. Late addition of Nec1 fails to ameliorate necroptosis in ATP depletion cases.

[[Autophagy is important for necroptosis]]
Opinion: Energy in general and ATP in particular are important determinants of whether cell death would occur in the cell. Autophagy is correlated with necroptosis in the case of ATP depletion. Necroptosis, not apoptosis, is related to autophagy; moreover, inhibition of caspases somehow promotes autophagy.
