> Receptor-interacting protein 1 kinase (RIP1K) plays a key role in necroptosis. Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), a specific inhibitor of RIP1K, provides neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury, associating with inhibition of inflammation. Recently, our group synthesized a novel analog of Nec-1, 5-(3',5'-dimethoxybenzal)-2-thio-imidazole-4-ketone (DTIO). The present study investigated the effect of DTIO on ischemic stroke-induced brain injury in both acute and chronic phase and its underlying mechanism. In vivo, DTIO treatment reduced infarct volume and improved neurological deficits in the acute phase after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) and it also attenuated brain atrophy and promoted brain functional recovery in the chronic phase post-cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). In vitro, DTIO treatment decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and necrotic cell death in the oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) or oxygen and glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced neuronal or astrocytic cell injury. Simultaneously, DTIO suppressed the production and release of inflammatory cytokines, and reduced the formation of glial scar. Homology modeling analysis illustrated that DTIO had an ability of binding to RIP1K. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation analysis showed that DTIO inhibited the phosphorylation of RIP1K and decreased the interaction between the RIP1K and RIP3K. In addition, knockdown of RIP1K had neuroprotective effects and inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokines, but didn't have a significant effect on DTIO-mediated neuroprotection. In conclusion, DTIO has protective effects on acute ischemic stroke and promotes functional recovery during chronic phase, associating with protecting ischemic neurons and astrocytes, inhibiting inflammation, and lessening the glial scar formation via inhibiting of the RIP1K.

> Briefly,  samples of medium and cell lysates were prepared following the manufacturer's  protocol for the LDH assay. The release of LDH was calculated using the following  equation: LDH leakage (%)=(OD value of the supernatant of the medium)/(OD value  of the supernatant of the medium+OD value of the supernatant of lysed cells) ×100%.
