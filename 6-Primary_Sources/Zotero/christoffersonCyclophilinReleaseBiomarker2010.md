  **Cyclophilin A (CypA) is DAMP that comperative release early ouside the cell to well-known HMGB1. Christofferson and Yuan speculated that CypA may be used as a valuabel early marker of necrotic cell deaht, both regular (necroptosis) and acidental (necrosis).**

> we have found that cyclophilin A (CypA), a cytosolic peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase, is released early in necroptosis. We propose that the release of CypA may be used as a biomarker for necroptosis and other cell death processes when the integrity of the plasma membrane is compromised.

> To examine whether CypA could be released by permeabilization of the cells, we treated cells with the detergent digitonin, which led to cell membrane permeabilization. We found that digitonin-permeabilized cells also release CypA (Supplementary Figure 4). This may explain why CypA is released during necroptosis, which exhibit early permeabilization of the plasma membrane. 
### Questions, things that I didn't understand

  **The autor shows an ability to use WB from the supernatante. So, the amount of protein must be relativly low. How does thay acomplishe such results?**
