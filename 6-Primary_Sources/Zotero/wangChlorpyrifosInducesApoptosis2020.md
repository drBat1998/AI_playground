> Excessive chlorpyrifos (CPF) in the environment causes toxicity to nontarget organisms by triggering oxidative stress. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) plays an important role in controlling apoptosis and necrosis by negatively regulating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/threonine kinase (PI3K/AKT) pathway. However, the effects of different concentrations of CPF on grass fish liver cell injury and the role of the ROS/PTEN/PI3K/AKT axis remain poorly understood. In this study, L8824 cells treated with different concentrations of CPF (0, 40, 60, or 80 μM) were used as the research object. The results showed that the median inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 112.226 μM. As the CPF concentrations increased, the ROS and MDA levels increased, and the T-AOC levels and SOD/GPx/GST activities decreased. As PTEN expression increased, PI3K/AKT, BCL-2, and Caspase-8 expression dramatically decreased. Conversely, RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL and Bax/Cyt-c/Caspase-3 expression increased. Additionally, necroptosis increased in a dose-dependent manner, while apoptosis first increased and then decreased. In conclusion, our study showed that CPF could trigger oxidative stress and induce apoptosis and necroptosis in fish liver cells by regulating the ROS/PTEN/PI3K/AKT axis, and the type of damage induced was dose-dependent. These results are meaningful for toxicological studies of CPF and efforts to protect the ecosystem.

  **ROS can activate PTEN.**

  **PI3K/AKT deficiency leads to cell death. PTEN can negatively regulate this pathway, so theoretically it could induce necroptosis or apoptosis, depends on circumstances.**

  **ROS induce PREN-related PI3K/AKT downregulation and induce cell death. Small number of ROS leads to apoptosis where large amount leads to necroptosis.**
