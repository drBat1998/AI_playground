> Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is known to both induce and inhibit apoptosis, however the mechanisms are unclear. We found that H2O2 inhibited the activity of recombinant caspase-3 and caspase-8, half-inhibition occurring at about 17 microM H2O2. This inhibition was both prevented and reversed by dithiothreitol while glutathione had little protective effect. 100-200 microM H2O2 added to macrophages after induction of caspase activation by nitric oxide or serum withdrawal substantially inhibited caspase activity. Activation of H2O2-producing NADPH oxidase in macrophages also caused catalase-sensitive inactivation of cellular caspases. The data suggest that the activity of caspases in cells can be directly but reversibly inhibited by H2O2.
