> We identified four specific PTMs with high confidence: butyrylation and propionylation on histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27br and H3K27pr, respectively) and histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9bu and H3K9pr) (Fig. 1c,d, Extended Data Fig. 1–2).

> Tributyrin treatment downregulated genes related to mitochondria and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as autophagy, while upregulated genes were related to glutathione metabolism and catabolic processes (Fig. 3g, Extended Data Fig. 6e, Supplementary Table 1). Together, this suggests that tributyrin increases histone butyrylation and results in gene expression changes that are enriched in metabolic programs.

> Another important course of future study is to separate the effects of histone butyrylation vs. acetylation. Sodium butyrate is an HDAC inhibitor, and as such has important biological roles, both in intestinal epithelial cells and other cell populations in the gut35,36. The use of additional model systems would be useful to tease apart the effects of these two similar histone PTMs37. Furthermore, our analyses are focused on gene expression in bulk epithelial cells from the intestine, and an important question is how cellular responses to butyrate and other microbial metabolites varies between different cell types in the gut. Finally, another limitation of our study is that our experiments are skewed towards female mice. An important area of future study will be investigating any potential sex differences in intestinal histone acylations.

> One class of metabolically regulated PTMs are histone acylations, which include histone acetylation, butyrylation, crotonylation, and propionylation3,8. 
  **Are Butyrylation and propionylation variant of histone acylations?**

> histone acylations 
  **What is histone acylations**

[[SCFAs promote specific histone modification, unrelated to HDAC inhibition]]
