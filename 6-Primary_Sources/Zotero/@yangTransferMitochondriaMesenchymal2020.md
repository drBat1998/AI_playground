# Abstract 
Mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons has been implicated in hypoxia-ischemia-induced brain injury. Although mesenchymal stem cell therapy has emerged as a novel treatment for this pathology, the mechanisms are not fully understood. To address this issue, we first co-cultured 1.5 × 105 PC12 cells with mesenchymal stem cells that were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells at a ratio of 1:1, and then intervened with cobalt chloride (CoCl2) for 24 hours. Reactive oxygen species in PC12 cells was measured by Mito-sox. Mitochondrial membrane potential (?Ψm) in PC12 cells was determined by JC-1 staining. Apoptosis of PC12 cells was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidal transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling staining. Mitochondrial morphology in PC12 cells was examined by transmission electron microscopy. Transfer of mitochondria from the mesenchymal stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells to damaged PC12 cells was measured by flow cytometry. Mesenchymal stem cells were induced from pluripotent stem cells by lentivirus infection containing green fluorescent protein in mitochondria. Then they were co-cultured with PC12 cells in Transwell chambers and treated with CoCl2 for 24 hours to detect adenosine triphosphate level in PC12 cells. CoCl2-induced PC12 cell damage was dose-dependent. Co-culture with mesenchymal stem cells significantly reduced apoptosis and restored ?Ψm in the injured PC12 cells under CoCl2 challenge. Co-culture with mesenchymal stem cells ameliorated mitochondrial swelling, the disappearance of cristae, and chromatin margination in the injured PC12 cells. After direct co-culture, mitochondrial transfer from the mesenchymal stem cells stem cells to PC12 cells was detected via formed tunneling nanotubes between these two types of cells. The transfer efficiency was greatly enhanced in the presence of CoCl2. More importantly, inhibition of tunneling nanotubes partially abrogated the beneficial effects of mesenchymal stem cells on CoCl2-induced PC12 cell injury. Mesenchymal stem cells reduced CoCl2-induced PC12 cell injury and these effects were in part due to efficacious mitochondrial transfer.
