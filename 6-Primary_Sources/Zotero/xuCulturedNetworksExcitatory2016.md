> Translating neuroprotective treatments from discovery in cell and animal models to the clinic has proven challenging. To reduce the gap between basic studies of neurotoxicity and neuroprotection and clinically relevant therapies, we developed a human cortical neuron culture system from human embryonic stem cells or human inducible pluripotent stem cells that generated both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks resembling the composition of the human cortex. This methodology used timed administration of retinoic acid to FOXG1(+) neural precursor cells leading to differentiation of neuronal populations representative of the six cortical layers with both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks that were functional and homeostatically stable. In human cortical neuronal cultures, excitotoxicity or ischemia due to oxygen and glucose deprivation led to cell death that was dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, nitric oxide (NO), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (a cell death pathway called parthanatos that is distinct from apoptosis, necroptosis, and other forms of cell death). Neuronal cell death was attenuated by PARP inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials for cancer treatment. This culture system provides a new platform for the study of human cortical neurotoxicity and suggests that PARP inhibitors may be useful for ameliorating excitotoxic and ischemic cell death in human neurons.

> The absence of retinoic acid treatment led to less sensitivity of human neuronal cultures to glutamate, NMDA and oxygen-glucose deprivation neurotoxicity (Fig. S5B–S5F).

> The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD, the necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (NEC-1), or the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, were not effective in altering NMDA or oxygen-glucose deprivation neurotoxicity (Fig. 6A, 6B)

> NMDAinduced or oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced PARP activity was assessed by a PAR immunoblot assay. The PARP inhibitor DPQ and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors LNAME or the selective nNOS inhibitor NPLA attenuated PAR formation (Fig. 6E, 6F). To confirm that activation of PARP was critical to NMDA or oxygen-glucose deprivation neurotoxicity, PARP-1 was knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 using two different single guide RNAs (sgRNA) (Fig. S6A). Knockout of PARP-1 by either sgRNA substantially attenuated NMDA or oxygen-glucose deprivation neurotoxicity (Fig. 6G, 6H).

> Furthermore, four PARP inhibitors that are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for cancer were evaluated for neuroprotective actions against NMDA or oxygen-glucose deprivation neurotoxicity. AG-014699, ABT-888, olaparib and BMN-673 all markedly attenuated NMDA or oxygenglucose deprivation neurotoxicity in human cortical neurons (Fig. 6I, 6J).
