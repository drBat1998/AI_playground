> Cellular therapy with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) protects cortical neurons against hypoxic-ischemic injury of stroke. Although sorts of efforts have been  made to confirm the neuroprotective effect of MSCs on neurons against  hypoxic-ischemic injury, the mechanism is until now far away from clear. Here in  this study, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-injured neuron model was applied to  mimic the neuronal hypoxic-ischemic injury in vitro. Co-culturing with MSCs in a  transwell co-culture system, the OGD injured neurons were rescued by 75.0 %.  Further data demonstrated that co-culturing with MSCs protected the cortical  neurons from the OGD-induced parthanatos by alleviating apoptosis-inducing factor  (AIF) nuclear translocation; attenuated the neuronal necroptosis by  down-regulating the expression of the two essential kinases in necroptosis,  receptor interacting protein kinase1 (RIP1) and 3 (RIP3); rescued the neurons  from apoptosis by deactivating caspase-3; whilst performed no significant  influence on OGD-induced neuronal autophagy, according to its failed regulation  on Beclin1. In conclusion, MSCs potentially protect the cortical neurons from  OGD-injury in vitro, through rescuing neurons from the cell death of parthanatos,  necroptosis, and apoptosis, but not autophagy, which could provide some evidence  to the mechanism explanation on stem cell treatment for ischemic stroke.

> To assess the neuroprotective effect of MSCs comparing with the selected inhibitors to parthanatos, necroptosis, apoptosis, and autophagy, PI/hoechst double staining was applied. The result demonstrated that the chemical inhibitors targeting at parthanatos (DPQ, 20 lM), necroptosis (nec-1, 30 lM), and apoptosis (Z-VAD.FMK, 100 lM) decreased neuronal cell death by 58.9, 56.2, 53.1 % as relatively comparing with the OGD-vehicle group, respectively (Fig. 1b, c). 
  **from first glance this data could leads to prominent role of parthanatos in OGD-induced cell death.**

> To verify whether MSCs co-culturing blocks nuclear translocation of AIF in neurons after OGD, which is a fundamental marker for parthanatos activation, immunostaining, and Western blot analysis were performed. 
  **AIF translocation is important marker of parthanatos activation**

> Solid evidence has been revealed that parthanatos and necroptosis play key roles in the pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Blocking these processes might provide new targets for the therapy for ischemic stoke (Northington et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2010; Moroni et al. 2012; Andrabi et al. 2011).

> AIF is a key mediator of parthanatos. AIF is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a precursor of 67 kDa (preAIF) and then imported into the mitochondria as a mature form (62 kDa). When oxidative stress happens, AIF is finally converted into a 57 kDa soluble form (tAIF) and translocated into the nucleus, which is a critical step

> Since MSCs and neurons are co-cultured in transwellÒ six well plates with 0.4 um polycarbonate membrane, there should not be any cell-cell contact, which suggest that MSC acts via paracrine modulation.
