> abstract:: Since several different pathways are involved in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, combination therapy rather than monotherapy may be required for efficient  neuroprotection. In this study, we examined the protective effects of an  apoptosis inhibitor Gly(14)-humanin (HNG) and a necroptosis inhibitor  necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) on hypoxia/ischemia/reperfusion injury. Cultured mouse  primary cortical neurons were incubated with Nec-1, HNG or both in a hypoxia  chamber for 60 min. Cell viability was determined by MTS assay at 24h after  oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment. Mice underwent middle cerebral artery  occlusion for 75 min followed by 24h reperfusion. Mice were administered HNG  and/or Nec-1 (i.c.v.) at 4h after reperfusion. Neurological deficits were  evaluated and the cerebral infarct volume was determined by TTC staining. Nec-1  or HNG alone had protective effects on OGD-induced cell death. Combined treatment  with Nec-1 and HNG resulted in more neuroprotection than Nec-1 or HNG alone.  Treatment with HNG or Nec-1 reduced cerebral infarct volume from 59.3 ± 2.6% to  47.0 ± 2.3% and 47.1 ± 1.5%, respectively. Combined treatment with HNG and Nec-1  improved neurological scores and decreased infarct volume to 38.6 ± 1.5%. In  summary, we demonstrated that the combination treatment of HNG and Nec-1  conferred synergistic neuroprotection on hypoxia/ischemia/reperfusion injury in  vitro and in vivo. These findings provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the  treatment of stroke by combining anti-apoptosis and anti-necroptosis therapy.

### ❓ Assumptions, Questions, Problems

> [!quote|purple]+ Highlight ([page. 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UFT8PC35?page=2&annotation=AIKYH8YV))
> The mechanism by which HNG achieves these effects involves decreasing cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP, a marker of caspase activity), inhibiting extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) activation (Xu et al., 2006a), and activating PI3K/Akt signal pathways (Xu et al., 2008). 
> - **Is the PARP associated with apoptosis?**
