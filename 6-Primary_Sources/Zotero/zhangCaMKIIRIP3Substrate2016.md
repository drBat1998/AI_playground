> Regulated necrosis (necroptosis) and apoptosis are crucially involved in severe cardiac pathological conditions, including myocardial infarction, ischemia-reperfusion injury and heart failure. Whereas apoptotic signaling is well defined, the mechanisms that underlie cardiomyocyte necroptosis remain elusive. Here we show that receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) triggers myocardial necroptosis, in addition to apoptosis and inflammation, through activation of Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) rather than through the well-established RIP3 partners RIP1 and MLKL. In mice, RIP3 deficiency or CaMKII inhibition ameliorates myocardial necroptosis and heart failure induced by ischemia-reperfusion or by doxorubicin treatment. RIP3-induced activation of CaMKII, via phosphorylation or oxidation or both, triggers opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and myocardial necroptosis. These findings identify CaMKII as a new RIP3 substrate and delineate a RIP3-CaMKII-mPTP myocardial necroptosis pathway, a promising target for the treatment of ischemia- and oxidative stress-induced myocardial damage and heart failure.

> Because cardiomyocyte necrosis has an important role in the pathogenesis of adverse cardiac remodeling and heart failure17, we next evaluated the potential contribution of RIP3 to these sequelae of I/R injury. In a chronic I/R experimental setting (30 min ischemia followed by 8 weeks of reperfusion) (Supplementary Fig. 1c), RIP3 deficiency effectively blocked I/R-induced cardiac remodeling, including fibrosis and hypertrophy (Fig. 1d,e and Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). Furthermore, I/R-induced cardiac contractile dysfunction (as indicated by decreases in ejection fraction and fractional shortening) and left ventricular dilation (as assessed by systolic left ventricular internal diameter) were fully abolished in Ripk3−/− mice (Fig. 1f–h). Chronic I/R-induced mortality was also lower in Ripk3−/− mice than in WT littermate controls (Fig. 1i). Thus, in vivo data in both acute and chronic models of I/R injury indicate that RIP3 is indispensable for I/R-induced myocardial necrosis and the sequelae of adverse cardiac remodeling and heart failure.

> Notably, overexpression of RIP3 by adenovirus vector (Ad-RIP3) in cultured cardiomyocytes led to robust necrosis in a dose-dependent fashion, as evidenced by a severe decline in cell viability (as assessed by ATP levels) and a loss of cell membrane integrity (as assessed by LDH release) (Fig. 3a,b).

> Unexpectedly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated RIP1 silencing did not block RIP3-induced cardiomyocyte necroptosis, as assessed by cell viability (cellular ATP levels) or LDH release (Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Fig. 4a), suggesting that RIP1 is not required for RIP3-induced cardiomyocyte necroptosis. This conclusion was corroborated by the failure of necrostatin-1 (Nec1), a RIP1 inhibitor23,24, to abolish RIP3-induced cardiomyocyte necroptosis (Supplementary Fig. 4b).

> Because MLKL has recently been identified as a direct substrate of RIP3 and serves as a key component of the necroptosis machinery11,14,27, we investigated its possible involvement in RIP3-mediated cardiac necroptosis. siRNA-mediated silencing of MLKL did not affect RIP3-induced cardiomyocyte necroptosis (Fig. 3e,f and Supplementary Fig. 4d). These results indicate that RIP1 and MLKL are dispensable for RIP3-induced necroptosis in cardiomyocytes.

> In cultured cardiomyocytes, adenoviral overexpression of RIP3 was sufficient to elevate phospho-Thr287 CaMKII levels by twofold (Fig. 4c). Inhibition of CaMKII with a selective inhibitor, KN-93, profoundly abrogated I/R-induced myocardial infarction and necrosis, as indicated by reduced infarct size and serum LDH concentration (Fig. 4d,e and Supplementary Fig. 5a)

> Notably, I/R (or H/R, in cells) or Dox treatment clearly increased the colocalization of RIP3 and CaMKII (Supplementary Fig. 6), consistent with their inducible co-immunoprecipitation.

> Inhibition of CaMKII blocked RIP3-induced ∆Ψm depolarization (Supplementary Fig. 9d–f), indicating that CaMKII is required for RIP3-induced opening of mPTP. Thus, mPTP is an important downstream effector in the RIP3-CaMKII cardiac cell death signaling cascade.

> In line with this notion, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Nox2, a key component of NADPH  oxidase, protected cardiomyocytes from RIP3-induced necroptosis (Supplementary Fig. 10a,b). Similarly, Tiron, a ROS scavenger, significantly reversed RIP3-induced necroptosis in cardiomyocytes (P < 0.01, one-way ANOVA; Supplementary Fig. 10c). Thus, ROS are involved in RIP3-induced cardiomyocyte necroptosis.

> . Thus, I/R injury and Dox treatment increase myocardial ROS production and CaMKII oxidation in a RIP3-dependent manner. Moreover, adenoviral overexpression of RIP3 was sufficient to elevate ROS levels and CaMKII oxidation in cultured cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5f,g).

> Thus, I/R injury and Dox treatment activate the RIP3-CaMKII pathway via two mechanisms—direct phosphorylation of CaMKII by RIP3 and indirect activation by ROS-mediated CaMKII oxidation—and both contribute to myocardial necroptosis, cardiac remodeling and heart failure (Fig. 5i).

> Our findings show that upregulation of RIP3 is essentially involved in both ischemia- and oxidative stress–triggered cardiac injury by inducing myocardial cell death (necroptosis as well as apoptosis), leading to maladaptive remodeling and heart failure. We have also identified CaMKII as a substrate of RIP3 that mediates RIP3-dependent myocardial necroptosis and apoptosis via regulation of mPTP opening. Lastly, we found that RIP3- and CaMKII-dependent cardiomyocyte necroptosis is independent of RIP1 and MLKL, thereby representing a new mode of necroptosis. We conclude that, in addition to its previously reported role in cardiomyocyte necroptosis and remodeling induced by MI13, RIP3 is essential for linking various detrimental stimuli to myocardial cell death and the resultant structural and functional defects; in particular, RIP3-dependent necroptosis contributes to I/R- and Dox-induced cardiac injury.

> Although both RIP3-mediated necroptosis and apoptosis contribute to I/R- and Dox-induced myocardial injury, under our conditions, ischemia- and oxidative stressinduced cardiomyocyte death was mediated primarily by necrosis (~70%, as compared to ~30% for apoptosis).
