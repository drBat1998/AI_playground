> In the chronic phase following ischemic stroke, glial scars can prevent axonal regeneration and the intensification of inflammation. The protective effect of inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) or receptor-interacting protein 1 kinase (RIP1K) on ischemic stroke has been previously reported. The current study examined the effects of RIP1K and GSK3β on ischemic stroke-induced glial scar formation. To investigate this, we used an in vivo model of ischemic stroke based on middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 min followed by reperfusion for 7 d, and an in vitro model in primary cultured astrocytes involving oxygen and glucose deprivation for 6 h followed by reoxygenation for 24 h. Both in vivo and in vitro, we found that SB216763, a GSK3β inhibitor, and necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), a RIP1K inhibitor, decreased levels of glial scar markers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurocan, and phosphacan. SB216763 and Nec-1 also decreased levels of inflammatory related cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). However, only Nec-1 increased the level of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Concurrent neutralization of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 with their antibodies provided better reduction in oxygen and glucose deprivation-induced increases in scar markers than obtained with separate use of each antibody. Further investigations showed that SB216763 reduced the levels of necroptosis-related proteins, including RIP1K, p-RIP1K, RIP3K, p-RIP3K, mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), and p-MLKL, while Nec-1 decreased the expression of p-GSK3β. Compared with Nec-1 (10 μM) and SB216763 (1 μM) alone, Nec-1 and SB216763 in combination reduced levels of GFAP, neurocan, and inflammatory-related cytokines. In conclusion, inhibition of GSK3β or RIP1K reduced glial scar formation induced by ischemic stroke. The underlying mechanisms might be at least, partially related to reducing levels of inflammatory-related cytokines and to blocking an interaction between GSK3β- and RIP1K-mediated pathways.

  **GSK3b is a serine-threonine protein kinase that had been shown to promotes astrocytosis. RIPK1 can induce GSK3b.**

> Conversely, SB216763 not only inhibited the level of p-GSK3b, but also reduced levels of RIP1K/ p-RIP1K, RIP3K/p-RIP3K, and MLKL/p-MLKL. Moreover, Nec-1 and/or SB216763 inhibited the LDH leakage and reduced numbers of PI-positive cells, demonstrating the protective effect of Nec-1 and SB216763 on OGD/re-induced 
  **Inhibition of p-GSK3β reduces the activity of the RIPK1–RIPK3–MLKL pathway and decreases LDH release and the number of PI-positive cells. This suggests that GSK3β acts upstream of necroptosis or contributes to a feedback loop that sustains it.**
