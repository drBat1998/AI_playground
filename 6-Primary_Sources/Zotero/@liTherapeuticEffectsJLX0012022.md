> In recent years, more attention has been given to novel patterns of cell death observed during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Necroptosis is a regulable secondary cell death pathway; necroptosis is different from traditional forms of cell death, and it is regulated by the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signaling pathway. JLX001 is the double hydrochloride of the natural compound cyclovirobuxine D (CVB-D). Previous studies have confirmed that CVB-D exerts a significant effect on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and that JLX001 can reduce ischemic brain injury by inhibiting cell apoptosis. For the first time, this project explored the in vivo and in vitro inhibitory effects of the therapeutic administration of JLX001 on the neuronal necroptosis caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). The middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was used to simulate I/R injury in rats in vivo, and oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) was used to simulate I/R injury in vitro. After the administration of JLX001, the relative expression of necroptosis-related molecules was measured by ELISA, RT-PCR, HE staining, immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The results showed that JLX001 significantly reduced pathological damage and the cerebral infarction rate in rat brain tissues, and the expression of neuronal necroptosis-related molecules was reduced, suggesting that JLX001 may regulate CIRI through the classic RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL necroptosis pathway.

> Boxwood is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that exerts the effects of dispelling rheumatism, regulating qi and relieving pain. Researchers have extracted the natural compound cyclovirobuxine D (CVB-D; molecular formula: C26H46N2O) from boxwood. Studies confirmed  that CVB-D exerts a significant effect on many cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.
