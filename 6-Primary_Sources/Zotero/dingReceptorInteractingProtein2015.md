> BACKGROUND: Necroptosis is a type of regulated form of cell death that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Receptor-interacting protein  3 (RIP3), a member of the RIP family of proteins, has been reported as an  important necroptotic pathway mediator in regulating a variety of human diseases,  such as myocardial ischemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and ischemic brain  injury. Our previous study showed that RIP3 was expressed in rat retinal ganglion  cells (RGCs), where it was significantly upregulated during the early stage of  acute high intraocular pressure. Furthermore, RIP3 expression was co-localized  with propidium iodide (PI)-positive staining (necrotic cells). These results  suggested that RIP3 up-regulation might be involved in the necrosis of injured  RGCs. In this study, we aimed to reveal the possible involvement of RIP3 in  oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced retinal ganglion cell-5 (RGC-5)  necroptosis. METHODS: RGC-5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's-modified essential  medium and necroptosis was induced by 8 h OGD. PI staining and flow cytometry  were performed to detect RGC-5 necrosis. RIP3 expression was detected by western  blot and flow cytometry was used to detect the effect of RIP3 on RGC-5  necroptosis following OGD in rip3 knockdown cells. Malondialdehyde (MDA) lipid  peroxidation assay was performed to determine the degree of oxidative stress.  RESULTS: PI staining showed that necrosis was present in the early stage of  OGD-induced RGC-5 cell death. The presence of RGC-5 necroptosis after OGD was  detected by flow cytometry using necrostatin-1, a necroptosis inhibitor. Western  blot demonstrated that RIP3 up-regulation may be involved in RGC-5 necroptosis.  Flow cytometry revealed that the number of OGD-induced necrotic RGC-5 cells was  reduced after rip3 knockdown. Furthermore, MDA levels in the normal RGC-5 cells  were much higher than in the rip3-knockdown cells after OGD. CONCLUSIONS: Our  findings suggest that RGC-5 cell necroptosis following OGD is mediated by a  RIP3-induced increase in oxidative stress.

> RIP3 in necroptosis [11], the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated by the activation of RIPs is probably the most studied and well accepted mechanism. Zhang et al. examined TNF-induced necrosis in NIH 3T3 cells and showed that RIP3 regulates TNF-induced ROS overproduction by activating metabolic enzymes, leading to necrosis via damaging of cellular membranes and organelles [12]. Son et al. [13] showed that Nec-1 can significantly reduce ROS production in Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-infected macrophages. 
  **Reactive oxygen species corelate with necroptosis and could be induced by RIP kinases. Moreover, the Nec-1 could decrease their production.**
