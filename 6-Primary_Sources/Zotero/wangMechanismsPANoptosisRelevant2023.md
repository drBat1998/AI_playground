> Pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis are mainly programmed cell death (PCD) pathways for host defense and homeostasis. PANoptosis is a newly distinct inflammatory PCD pathway that is uniquely regulated by multifaceted PANoptosome complexes and highlights significant crosstalk and coordination among pyroptosis (P), apoptosis (A), and/or necroptosis(N). Although some studies have focused on the possible role of PANpoptosis in diseases, the pathogenesis of PANoptosis is complex and underestimated. Furthermore, the progress of PANoptosis and related agonists or inhibitors in disorders has not yet been thoroughly discussed. In this perspective, we provide perspectives on PANoptosome and PANoptosis in the context of diverse pathological conditions and human diseases. The treatment targeting on PANoptosis is also summarized. In conclusion, PANoptosis is involved in plenty of disorders including but not limited to microbial infections, cancers, acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), ischemia-reperfusion, and organic failure. PANoptosis seems to be a double-edged sword in diverse conditions, as PANoptosis induces a negative impact on treatment and prognosis in disorders like COVID-19 and ALI/ARDS, while PANoptosis provides host protection from HSV1 or Francisella novicida infection, and kills cancer cells and suppresses tumor growth in colorectal cancer, adrenocortical carcinoma, and other cancers. Compounds and endogenous molecules focused on PANoptosis are promising therapeutic strategies, which can act on PANoptosomes-associated members to regulate PANoptosis. More researches on PANoptosis are needed to better understand the pathology of human conditions and develop better treatment.

### Ideas, thoughts, useful information

> PANoptosis, which was newly termed by the Kanneganti team in 2019, is a distinctly inflammatory PCD pathway that integrates pivotal components from other cell death pathways, including pyroptosis (P), apoptosis (A), and/or necroptosis (N), highlighting their crosstalk and coordination [5]. 
  **In 2019, Kanneganti et al. speculated that previously distinct death pathways, apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis, are coordinated and, in some sense, crosstalk.**

> PANoptosome is mainly composed of three kinds of proteins: (1) sensor proteins such as Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1), which is also known as DNA-dependent activator of interferon regulatory factor (DAI), and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3); (2) adapter proteins with a caspase recruit domain, such as apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC); and (3) RIPK1, RIPK3, and caspase-1/8, which have catalytic effects [12]. 
  **PANoptosome consists of sensor proteins, adapter proteins, and catalytic ones.**

> PANoptosis-like cell death involving important members of the PANoptosome (caspase1, NLRP3, and RIPK3) occurred in I/R-injured retinal neurons in vitro  and in vivo [81].
