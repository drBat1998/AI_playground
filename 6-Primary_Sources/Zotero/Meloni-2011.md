> abstract:: Using 96 well microtitre plate sized glass wells we have established and characterised two in vitro ischemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation) models that  induce acute or delayed neuronal cell death. In vitro ischemia was induced by  washing cortical neuronal cultures with a balanced salt solution either with  (acute model) or without (delayed model) 25mM 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and incubating  in an anaerobic chamber. Reperfusion was performed by removing cultures from the  anaerobic chamber and adding glucose containing media (delayed model) or removing  the balanced salt solution/2-deoxy-d-glucose medium (acute model) and adding  glucose containing media. The models were characterised with respect to in vitro  ischemia dose duration, cell death time course and for necrosis, apoptosis,  autophagy and necroptosis biomarkers. To this end, biomarkers for all four modes  of cell death were detected in both in vitro ischemia models, although the time  of onset and relative proportion of each cell death mode differed between models.  While it is likely that different modes of cell death were activated in the same  cell, autophagy appeared to be a prominent cell death mode, especially in the  delayed model. Together these models will provide valuable tools to further  investigate ischemic neuronal death/survival mechanisms and provide a  high-throughput screening system to evaluate potential neuroprotective agents.

> Apoptotic and necrotic neuronal death modes were detected by the addition of annexin V-FITC (annexin V; 0.4  g/ml) (Clontech, USA), and propidium iodide (PI; 0.05  g/ml) (Clontech), 10 min prior to visualisation using an epifluorescence microscope (excitation wavelength 380 nm and emission wavelength 525 nm).

> Necrostatin-1 inhibited a small proportion of neuronal death in our in vitro ischemia models. While necrostatin-1 has been shown to reduce brain injury following focal ischemia (Degterev et al., 2005), it is not surprising that necroptosis did not play a more significant role in neuronal death following in vitro ischemia as it is thought to be mediated by extracellular TNF  and FasL activating death receptors. As the neuronal cultures consist of predominantly neurons, it is likely that TNF  and FasL levels in culture do not reach the extracellular levels that would occur in the brain following cerebral ischemia. In addition, as cell death inhibition was only observed at high necrostatin-1 concentrations (30–50  M) it is possible that this inhibitor was interfering with other cell death pathways. 
> - **it is possible that necroptosis plays a more prominent role in mixed culture and whole animal models than in clean neuron culture.**
