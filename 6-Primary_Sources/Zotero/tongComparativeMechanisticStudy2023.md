> Oxidative stress is hypothesized to drive the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell layer is important for supporting the function of retina and is particularly susceptible to oxidative stress-induced cell death. How RPE cells die in AMD, especially in geographic atrophy (GA), a late stage of dry AMD, is still controversial. The goal of this study is to compare the features and mechanisms of RPE cell death induced by different oxidative stresses, to identify potential universal therapeutic targets for GA. RPE cell death was induced both in vitro and ex vivo by 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a major product of lipid peroxidation, sodium iodate (NaIO3) that has been widely used to model RPE cell death in dry AMD, a ferroptosis inducer RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) or a necroptosis inducer shikonin. We found that RPE necroptosis and ferroptosis show common and distinct features. Common features include receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)1/RIPK3 activation and lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, although lipid ROS accumulation is much milder during necroptosis. This supports cross talk between RPE ferroptosis and necroptosis pathways and is consistent with the rescue of RPE necroptosis and ferroptosis by RIPK1 inhibitor Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) or in Ripk3-/- RPE explants. Distinct feature includes activated mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase (MLKL) that is translocated to the cell membrane during necroptosis, which is not happening in ferroptosis. This is consistent with the failure to rescue RPE ferroptosis by MLKL inhibitor necrosulfonamide (NSA) or in Mlkl-/- RPE explants. Using this framework, we found that 4-HNE and NaIO3 induced RPE cell death likely through necroptosis based on the molecular features and the rescuing effect by multiple inhibitors. Our studies suggest that multiple markers and inhibitors are required to distinguish RPE necroptosis and ferroptosis, and that necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1 could be a potential therapeutic compound for GA since it inhibits RIPK1/RIPK3 activation and lipid ROS accumulation occurred in both necroptosis and ferroptosis pathways.

> Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative disease of the retinal macula and is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly [1]. Macula is the central region of the retina which is critical for the central vision [2]. AMD patients eventually develop irreversible central vision loss, which leads to low life quality and high economic burden [2].

> By using neutral red assay, caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK or NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 failed to rescue 4-HNE-induced ARPE-19 cell death (Fig. S1E), suggesting that apoptosis and pyroptosis are not the major contributors of 4-HNE-induced RPE cell death.

> In contrast, ferroptosis inhibitors Liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1, 0.1 μM) and Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, 0.1 μM) and necroptosis inhibitors Nec-1 (30 μM) and NSA (0.5 μM) dramatically rescued ARPE-19 cells after 4HNE treatment at 45 μM, as shown by MTT assay (Fig. 1B and C

> Markers of necroptosis and ferroptosis pathways were further examined to confirm their involvement in 4-HNE-induced RPE cell death. Activation of necrosome shown by RIPK3 phosphorylation and aggregation followed by the activation of MLKL and its translocation to the cell membrane are known major markers of necroptosis.

> RPE morphology and cell death  were examined by flat mount afterwards. Nontreated Ripk3 / , Mlkl /  and Ripk3 / /Mlkl / RPE explants showed normal and healthy RPE morphology. Consistent with the inhibitors data, significantly reduced  4-HNE-induced RPE death was observed in Ripk3 / , Mlkl / and  Ripk3 / /Mlkl / RPE explants. The RPE layer in those groups appeared mostly normal after treatment by phalloidin staining (Fig. 2E, S2D).

> The surprising results of Nec-1 and NSA prompted us to test whether classic ferroptosis inducer RSL3 activates necroptotic pathway. Induction of RIPK1 phosphorylation was observed in ARPE-19 at 6 h after RSL3 treatment by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). RIPK3 phosphorylation was also observed at 2 h after RSL3 treatment and continued to increase at 4- and 6-h post treatment by immunostaining (Fig. 4B, S3G)

> ombined with the partially inhibitory effect of Nec-1 on RSL3-induced lipid ROS accumulation, these suggest the lipid ROS accumulation acts both upstream and downstream of RIPK1/RIPK3 activation during ferroptosis. As to NSA, consistent with its failure to rescue RSL3-induced RPE cell death, phospho-MLKL was not observed at 2 and 4 h after RSL3 treatment (Fig. 4D, S3I).

> Together, these results suggest that RIPK1/RIPK3 activation but not phospho-MLKL cell membrane localization is also involved in ferroptosis, and that lipid ROS accumulation exists both upstream and downstream of RIPK1/RIPK3 activation during RPE ferroptosis

> Together, these data suggest necroptosis has distinct features including activated MLKL on the cell membrane, while RIPK1/RIPK3 activation may not be specific to necroptosis. Lipid ROS accumulation, although not as robust as in ferroptosis, is observed during RPE necroptosis. However, this mild lipid ROS accumulation is not required for RPE necroptosis, as Lip-1 only partially rescued shikonin-induced RPE cell death in vitro and was not working ex vivo

> We found that (Figs. 3–5, summarized in Fig. 7B): (1) RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1 represses  RSL3-induced ferroptosis and shikonin-induced necroptosis, which was  confirmed using Ripk3 / mouse RPE explants. Ferroptosis inhibitors Lip-1 and Fer-1 repress RSL3-induced RPE ferroptosis but are only minimally effective in repressing shikonin-induced RPE necroptosis; (2) Consistent with the effectiveness of Nec-1, RIPK1 and RIPK3 activation occurs under both necroptosis and ferroptosis; (3) MLKL inhibitor NSA and Mlkl genetic deletion fail to repress RSL3-induced RPE ferroptosis and only represses shikonin-induced RPE necroptosis in short term. In  contrast, RSL3-induced RPE cell death was rescued in Ripk3 / , Ripk3 /  /Mlkl / but not Mlkl / mice, which confirmed the importance of RIPK3 but not MLKL in the ferroptosis pathway. Consistently, MLKL phosphorylation occurs under both conditions, but is only localized to the cell membrane during shikonin-induced necroptosis; (4) Accumulation of oxidized lipid occurs in both conditions, with relatively mild induction by necroptosis inducer shikonin (~5-6 folds) but drastic induction by ferroptosis inducer RSL3 (~30 folds); (5) CytoGPX4 overexpression is effective in repressing RSL3-induced RPE ferroptosis but fails to prevent shikonin-induced RPE necroptosis; (6) HMGB1 release could occur in either necroptosis or ferroptosis, which is dependent on the types of stresses. These data suggest multiple markers and inhibitors are required to distinguish between necroptosis and ferroptosis, as they show common features and distinct differences.
