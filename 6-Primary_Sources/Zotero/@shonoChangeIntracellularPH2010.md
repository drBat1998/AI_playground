> Brain hypoxia or ischemia causes acidosis and the intracellular accumulation of Ca(2+) in neuron. The aims of the present study were to elucidate the interaction between intracellular pH and Ca(2+) during transient acidosis and its effects on the viability of neuronal and glial cells. Intracellular Ca(2+) and pH were measured using the fluorescence of fura-2 and 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester in neuroblastoma (IMR-32), glioblastoma (T98G), and astrocytoma (CCF-STTG1) cell lines. The administration of 5 mM propionate caused intracellular acidification in IMR-32 and T98G cells but not in CCF-STTG1 cells. After the removal of propionate, the intracellular pH recovered to the resting level. The intracellular Ca(2+) transiently increased upon the removal of propionate in IMR-32 and T98G cells but not in CCF-STTG1 cells. The transient Ca(2+) increase caused by the withdrawal of intracellular acidification was abolished by the removal of external Ca(2+), diminished by a reduction of external Na(+), and inhibited by benzamil. Transient acidosis caused cell death, whereas the cells were more viable in the absence of external Ca(2+). Benzamil alleviated cell death caused by transient acidosis in IMR-32 and T98G cells but not in CCF-STTG1 cells. These results suggest that recovery from intracellular acidosis causes a transient increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) due to reversal of Ca(2+) transport via Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger coactivated with Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, which can cause cell death.

  **Propionate in large concentration (5mM and more) induce intracellular acidosis. This information important to my research because explain why large amount of SCFAs may have ditiriorate roles.**
