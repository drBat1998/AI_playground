> Immunocytochemistry (ICC) confirmed the presence of MitoTracker-labeled mitochondria, LAMP1/LAMP2-positive lysosomes, and LC3bpositive autophagosomes within the zombosomes (Figure 2C). Moreover, zombosomes express RNA and the ribosomal translation initiation factor EIF2, elements required for protein synthesis. The exosome-related protein Flotillin-1, the matrix remodeling matrix-metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2),11 and the autophagy-associated protein p6212 were also found to be elements of the zombosomal cargo (Figure 2C).

[[zombosomes]]
Zombosomes are a delivery system that contains organelles, vimentin core, and other proteins. The system is not passive and actively moves in a short range. 

This delivery system is specific to astrocytes, although something similar exists in cancer cells ( blebbisomes), and C. elegans neurons and mammalian cardiomyocytes (exophers). Despite significant similarities with exophers, zombosomes can actively migrate.

The zombosome may play an important role in the spreading of misfolded and pathological proteins, such as a-synuclein. Neurons exposed to a-synuclein contained zombosomes showed a significant p-α-syn level. So, the zombosomes can promote protein production in anatomically connected regions alongside tunneling nanotubes and extracellular vesicles. 
[[tunneling nanotubes]]

It is interesting, do tunneling nanotubes or zombosomes promote cell death through spreading key cell death proteins?
