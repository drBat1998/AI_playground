> abstract:: The brain and gastrointestinal tract are critical sensory organs responsible for detecting, relaying, integrating, and responding to signals derived from the internal and external environment. At the interface of this sensory function, immune cells in the intestines and brain consistently survey environmental factors, eliciting responses that inform on the physiological state of the body. Recent research reveals that cross-talk along the gut-brain axis regulates inflammatory nociception, inflammatory responses, and immune homeostasis. Here, we discuss molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the signaling of inflammation across the gut-brain axis. We further highlight interactions between the gut and the brain in inflammation-associated diseases.
