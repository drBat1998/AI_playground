> To date, there is no good evidence that intestine epithelial cells (IEC) affected by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury are able to cause cortical neuron injury  directly. Additionally, it remains unclear whether the neuronal damage caused by  I/R injured IEC can be affected by therapeutic hypothermia (TH, 32 °C). To  address these questions, we performed an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)  affected IEC-6-primary cortical neuron coculture system under normothermia  (37 °C) or TH (32 °C) conditions. It was found that OGD caused hyperpermeability  in IEC-6 cell monolayers. OGD-preconditioned IEC-6 cells caused cortical neuronal  death (e.g., decreased cell viability), synaptotoxicity, and neuronal apoptosis  (evidenced by increased caspase-3 expression and the number of TUNEL-positive  cells), necroptosis (evidenced by increased receptor-interacting  serine/threonine-protein kinase-1 [RIPK1], RIPK3 and mixed lineage kinase  domain-like pseudokinase [MLKL] expression), and pyroptosis (evidenced by an  increase in caspase-1, gasdermin D [GSDMD], IL-1β, IL-18, the  apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain  [ASC], and nucleotide oligomerization domain [NOD]-like receptor [NLRP]-1  expression). TH did not affect the intestinal epithelial hyperpermeability but  did attenuate OGD-induced neuronal death and synaptotoxicity. We also performed  quantitative real-time PCR to quantify the genes encoding 84 exosomal microRNAs  in the medium of the control-IEC-6, the control-neuron, the OGD-IEC-6 at 37 °C,  the OGD-IEC-6 at 32 °C, the neuron cocultured with OGD-IEC-6 at 37 °C, and the  neurons cocultured with OGD-IEC-6 at 32 °C. We found that the control IEC-6 cell  s or cortical neurons are able to secrete a basal level of exosomal miRNAs in  their medium. OGD significantly up-regulated the basal level of each parameter  for IEC-6 cells. As compared to those of the OGD-IEC-6 cells or the control  neurons, the OGD-IEC-6 cocultured neurons had significantly higher levels of 19  exosomal miRNAs related to apoptosis, necroptosis, and/or pyroptosis events. Our  results identify that I/R injured intestinal epithelium cells can induce cortical  neuron death via releasing paracrine mediators such as exosomal miRNAs associated  with apoptosis, necroptosis, and/or pyroptosis, which can be counteracted by TH.

  **1. Necroptosis and pyroptosis are related if not coinduced. 
2. During ischemia of intestine epithelial cells, the cells produce exosomes that could negativly influence neuron through cell death.
3. Hypothermia reduce cell death.**
