> Microglia/macrophages play a crucial role in inflammation after spinal cord injury (SCI). Although extensive studies have been performed on the mechanisms of  microglia/macrophage activation and recruitment, how microglia/macrophages are  eliminated remains unclear. In the present study, we observed a high-level  expression of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), a key molecule in  the execution of necroptosis, in microglia/macrophages after SCI in mice. In vivo  PI-labeling and Necrostatin-1 treatment confirmed the necroptosis of  microglia/macrophages. Interestingly, our electronic microscopic (EM) study  revealed that MLKL localized not only at the membrane but also on the endoplasmic  reticulum (ER) of necroptotic microglia/macrophages. Furthermore,  receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3), another necrosome component, was also  found on the ER of necroptotic microglia/macrophages. And Glucose-regulated  protein 78 (GRP78), an ER stress sensor, was up-regulated in MLKL-positive  microglia/macrophages after SCI, suggesting a possible link between necroptosis  and ER stress. In vitro, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stress induced ER  stress and necroptosis in microglia. Inhibiting ER stress by 4-phenylbutyrate  (4-PBA) significantly blocked the OGD-induced necroptosis of microglia. In the  end, our data showed that, GRP78 and phosphorylated MLKL were co-expressed by the  microglia/macrophages in the injured human spinal cord. Taken together, these  results suggested that microglia/macrophages undergo an ER-stress involved  necroptosis after SCI, implying that ER stress and necroptosis could be  manipulated for modulating inflammation post-SCI.

  **MLKL in context of spinal cord injury is expressed mainly in microglia (57%) and astrocytes (34%). In contrast, neuron MLKL colocalization is quite low 2.5%.**

  **Triple-immunostaining of cell marker /cleaved  caspase-3 (CC3)/MLKL showed how many cells undergo apoptosis and necroptosis respectively.**

  **GRP78 and p-eIF2a are two markers of ER stress**
