> During apoptosis, cytochrome c is released into the cytosol as the outer membrane of mitochondria becomes permeable, and this acts to trigger caspase activation. The consequences of this release for mitochondrial metabolism are unclear. Using single-cell analysis, we found that when caspase activity is inhibited, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization causes a rapid depolarization of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, which recovers to original levels over the next 30-60 min and is then maintained. After outer membrane permeabilization, mitochondria can use cytoplasmic cytochrome c to maintain mitochondrial transmembrane potential and ATP production. Furthermore, both cytochrome c release and apoptosis proceed normally in cells in which mitochondria have been uncoupled. These studies demonstrate that cytochrome c release does not affect the integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane and that, in the absence of caspase activation, mitochondrial functions can be maintained after the release of cytochrome c.

> In this paper, we have shown that after the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, DCm transiently decreases. When caspase activation is blocked, DCm then recovers and is maintained by  the low levels of cytochrome c diffuse throughout the cell. In cells that have released cytochrome c in the absence of caspase activation, the maintenance of DCm is sufficient for the mitochondria to generate ATP.

> In addition to maintenance of DCm, we found that in the absence of caspase activation ATP synthesis by the mitochondria (i.e., oligomycin-sensitive maintenance of ATP levels) continues in cells despite mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (Fig. 5). These data show that even though the outer mitochondrial membrane has been permeabilized, the mitochondrial inner membrane remains intact, the electron transport chain and ATP synthase remain functional, and the cytochrome c within the cytosol is sufficient to drive oxidative phosphorylation. These conclusions are supported by previous studies that show that isolated mitochondria treated with tBid maintain their ability to import protein after cytochrome c release (von Ahsen et al., 2000).
