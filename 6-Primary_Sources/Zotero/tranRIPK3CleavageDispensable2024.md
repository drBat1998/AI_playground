> Caspase-8 activity is required to inhibit necroptosis during embryogenesis in mice. In vitro studies have suggested that caspase-8 directly cleaves RIPK1, CYLD and the key necroptotic effector kinase RIPK3 to repress necroptosis. However, recent studies have shown that mice expressing uncleavable RIPK1 die during embryogenesis due to excessive apoptosis, while uncleavable CYLD mice are viable. Therefore, these results raise important questions about the role of RIPK3 cleavage. To evaluate the physiological significance of RIPK3 cleavage, we generated Ripk3D333A/D333A mice harbouring a point mutation in the conserved caspase-8 cleavage site. These mice are viable, demonstrating that RIPK3 cleavage is not essential for blocking necroptosis during development. Furthermore, unlike RIPK1 cleavage-resistant cells, Ripk3D333A/D333A cells were not significantly more sensitive to necroptotic stimuli. Instead, we found that the cleavage of RIPK3 by caspase-8 restricts NLRP3 inflammasome activation-dependent pyroptosis and IL-1β secretion when Inhibitors of APoptosis (IAP) are limited. These results demonstrate that caspase-8 does not inhibit necroptosis by directly cleaving RIPK3 and further underscore a role for RIPK3 in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome.

> The rescue of the midgestational lethality to birth of catalytically inactive caspase-8 mice, Casp8C362A/C362A, by Mlkl-/- mice supports the idea that caspase-8 must cleave other proteins to prevent necroptosis activation during embryogenesis [23, 24].

> Therefore, RIPK3 might be the primary necroptotic caspase-8 substrate supporting the current model of necroptosis repression. However, RIPK3 cleavage has only been demonstrated in overexpression systems [31]. This prompted us to investigate its physiological role using cleavage resistant RIPK3 mutant mice.

  **RIPK3 has been discribed as essential component for necroptosis activation. Cleavege of RIPK3 by CASP8 had been sugested as crusial checkpoints between apoptosis and necroptosis. CASP8 genetic disactivation leads to embriological death in mice, and only inhibition of MLKL the executor molecule in necroptosis help the mice. However, Tran et al, chelenge that, by extremly beutiful experiment by the desing they disrup not CASP8 in its ability to clevege but RIPK3 to be cleveged. The experiment leads to unexpected results, necroptosis wasn't compromise in slitest, on the contrary, pyroptosis mechanism has been reduce. So, this findings only streng my thoughts how litle we know about cell death.**

> The proximity of caspase-8, RIPK1 and RIPK3 within complex II/ RIPoptosome, as well as the rescue of Casp8-deficient and catalytically inactive mice by loss of Ripk3 or Mlkl supports the notion that caspase-8 cleaves RIPK3 to prevent necroptosis. However, unlike the non-cleavable RIPK1 mice, our findings reveal that the genetic blockade of RIPK3 cleavage at D333 does not lead to uncontrolled lethal necroptosis. These results suggest the existence of other molecular mechanisms that may substitute or cooperate with RIPK3 cleavage in suppressing necroptosis.

> Significantly, our study provides new insights by revealing that RIPK3 cleavage is a negative feedback mechanism to restrain excessive NLPR3 inflammasome activation in situations when IAPs are scarce. 

[[RIPK3 cleavage does not prevent necroptosis]]


 RIPK3 has been described as an essential component for necroptosis activation. Cleavage of RIPK3 by CASP8 has been suggested as a crucial checkpoint between apoptosis and necroptosis. CASP8 genetic disactivation leads to midgestational lethality or death at birth in mice, and only inhibition of MLKL, the executor molecule in necroptosis, rescues the mice. However, Tran et al. challenge that by an extremely beautiful experiment by design. They disrupt not CASP8 in its ability to cleave, but RIPK3 in its ability to be cleaved. The experiment leads to unexpected results: necroptosis wasn’t compromised in the slightest; on the contrary, pyroptosis mechanisms were reduced. So, these findings only strengthen my thoughts about how little we know about cell death.
