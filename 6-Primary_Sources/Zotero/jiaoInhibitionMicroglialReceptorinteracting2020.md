> Microglia are rapidly activated following ischaemic stroke and participate in the induction of neuroinflammation, which exacerbates the injury of ischaemic stroke. However, the mechanisms regulating ischaemic microglia remain unclear. In the present study, middle cerebral artery occlusion and oxygen and glucose deprivation models were established for in vivo and vitro monitoring of experimental stroke. We applied recombinant human thioredoxin-1 (rhTrx-1) and Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1, inhibitor of RIPK1) to examine the role of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) in the development of inflammation in ischaemic microglia via explored the inflammatory responses and the associated mechanisms. Molecular docking results indicated that rhTrx-1 could directly bind to RIPK1. In vivo and vitro data revealed that rhTrx-1 reduced necroptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential damage, reactive oxygen species accumulation and NLR Family, pyrin domain-containing 3 protein (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and regulated the microglial M1/M2 phenotypic changes by inhibiting RIPK1 expression in ischaemic microglia. Consistent with these findings, further in vivo experiments revealed that rhTrx-1 treatment attenuated cerebral ischaemic injury by inhibiting the inflammatory response. Our data demonstrated the role of RIPK1 in microglia-induced neuroinflammation following cerebral ischaemia. Administration of rhTrx-1 provides neuroprotection in ischaemic stroke-induced microglial neuroinflammation by inhibiting RIPK1 expression.

> In addition to relying on the necroptotic  pathway to release inflammatory factors, RIPK1 can also release  inflammatory factors by driving NLRP3 inflammasome activation.11  Intracerebroventricular injections of Nec-1 (a specific inhibitor of  RIPK1) can prematurely reduce the volume of cerebral infarction  more effectively compared with the therapeutic effects noted by  the inhibition of apoptosis.12,13

> Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is a small molecular weight  hydrogen donor widely present in cells and exhibits a variety of  biological functions, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory  activities.15,16 Previous studies have shown that overexpression  of Trx-1 provides effective neuroprotective effects on the brain  tissue of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice, while in hibition of Trx-1 exacerbates the neuroinflammatory response

> ROS accumulation was able to activate the NLRP3 inflam masome, and the activated NLRP3 inflammasome subsequently  mediated neuroinflammation during ischaemic stroke by secretion IL-1β.
