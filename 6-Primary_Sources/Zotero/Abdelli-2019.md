> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by glia over-proliferation, neuro-inflammation, perturbed neural circuitry, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The role of gut dys-biosis in ASD is intriguing and should be elucidated. We investigated the effect of Propionic acid (PPA), a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and a product of dys-biotic ASD gut, on human neural stem cells (hNSCs) proliferation, differentiation and inflammation. hNSCs proliferated to 66 neuropsheres when exposed to PPA versus 45 in control. The neurosphere diameter also increased at day 10 post PPA treatment to (Mean: 193.47 um ± SEM: 6.673 um) versus (154.16 um ± 9.95 um) in control, p < 0.001. Pre-treatment with β-HB, SCFA receptor inhibitor, hindered neurosphere expansion (p < 0.001). While hNSCs spontaneously differentiated to (48.38% ± 6.08%) neurons (Tubulin-IIIβ positive) and (46.63% ± 2.5%) glia (GFAP positive), PPA treatment drastically shifted differentiation to 80% GFAP cells (p < 0.05). Following 2 mM PPA exposure, TNF-α transcription increased 4.98 fold and the cytokine increased 3.29 fold compared to control (P < 0.001). Likewise, GPR41 (PPA receptor) and pro-survival p-Akt protein were elevated (p < 0.001). PTEN (Akt inhibitor) level decreased to (0.42 ug/ul ± 0.04 ug/ul) at 2 mM PPA compared to (0.83 ug/ul ± 0.09 ug/ul) in control (p < 0.001). PPA at 2 mM decreased neurite outgrowth to (80.70 um ± 5.5 um) compared to (194.93 um ± 19.7 um) in control. Clearly, the data supports a significant role for PPA in modulating hNSC patterning leading to gliosis, disturbed neuro-circuitry, and inflammatory response as seen in ASD.

> ASD is believed to be the result of an interplay between genetic predisposition, environmental insults,  and maternal immune system abnormalities during the early gestational period 2,6,7.

> In neonatal Propionic Acidemia (PA), Propionyl CoA Carboxylase (PCC), involved in the metabolism of amino and fatty acids, is not functional due to a mutation in one of the two genes that code for its Alpha and Beta subunits; PCCA and PCCB. As a result, PPA accumulates in the blood causing severe seizures, movement disorders, gastrointestinal issues, aloofness, and overall developmental delays13 
  **What is propionic acidemia? it could be a clue to the deteriorating effect of these acids. How to test propionyl CoA carboxylase?**

> Unexpectedly, BA, another SCFA used in this study as a control, seems to play a potential pro-neural role by virtue of increased neural cell count upon BA treatment (Figs 2 and 3). Interestingly, excess neural proliferation and macrocephaly were also linked to ASD21,24,37.

  **Propionic acid inhibits PTEN and promotes pAKT in case of hNSC.
Butyric acid on the contrary, promotes PTEN and inhibits pAkt.**
