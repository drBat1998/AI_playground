# Abstract 
Liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) commonly occurs in liver resection, liver transplantation, shock, and other hemorrhagic conditions, resulting in profound local and systemic effects via associated inflammatory responses and hepatic cell death. Hepatocyte death is a significant component of LIRI and its mechanism was previously thought to be limited to apoptosis and necrosis. With the discovery of novel types of programmed cell death (PCD), necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, autophagy, NETosis, and parthanatos have been shown to be involved in LIRI. Understanding the mechanisms underlying cell death following LIRI is indispensable to mitigating the widespread effects of LIRI. Here, we review the roles of different PCD and discuss potential therapy in LIRI.

> [!note] 
Mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-dependent necrosis induction factor is an enigma for me. However, MPT-dependent necrosis occurs in ischemic reperfusion damage, and the morphology is necrotic, so the necrotic player activates faster, despite the induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis would be induced without doubt, but death would come from something else.
