> Necroptosis, necrosis and secondary necrosis following apoptosis represent different modes of cell death that eventually result in similar cellular morphology including rounding of the cell, cytoplasmic swelling, rupture of the plasma membrane and spilling of the intracellular content. Subcellular events during tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced necroptosis, H2O2-induced necrosis and anti-Fas-induced secondary necrosis were studied using high-resolution time-lapse microscopy. The cellular disintegration phase of the three types of necrosis is characterized by an identical sequence of subcellular events, including oxidative burst, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, lysosomal membrane permeabilization and plasma membrane permeabilization, although with different kinetics. H2O2-induced necrosis starts immediately by lysosomal permeabilization. In contrast, during TNF-mediated necroptosis and anti-Fas-induced secondary necrosis, this is a late event preceded by a defined signaling phase. TNF-induced necroptosis depends on receptor-interacting protein-1 kinase, mitochondrial complex I and cytosolic phospholipase A2 activities, whereas H2O2-induced necrosis requires iron-dependent Fenton reactions.

> On TNF stimulation, ROS generation gradually increased without major morphological changes (Figure 1a and b, between points t1 and t3, Supplementary video 1a), followed by an oxidative burst before PMP. In contrast, in H2O2induced necrosis, the onset of an oxidative burst occurred more rapidly (Figure 1c and d, Supplementary video 2a). In both conditions, the beginning of the ROS peak coincided with the initiation of typical necrotic features, such as rounding and swelling of cells (Figure 1a, Supplementary video 1b and Figure 1c, Supplementary video 2b). None of the above-mentioned observations were seen in unstimulated cells (Supplementary Figure 2a). Conclusively, TNF elicits a modest increase in ROS production during the signaling phase, which is followed by an oxidative burst coinciding with

> LMP has been reported as a crucial event during apoptosis and necrosis,14 we next analyzed lysosomal integrity using LysoTracker Red DND-99. During TNF-induced necroptosis, the onset of the typical oncosis morphology coincided with the start of LMP (Figure 3a and b, point t4, Supplementary video 5a and b), just after the onset of mitochondrial hyperpolarization (Figure 2a) and before oxidative burst (Figure 1a). In contrast, on addition of H2O2, lysosomes rapidly started to leak (Figure 3c and d, Supplementary video 6a and b), which persists longer than in TNF-induced

  **In general necrosis, regulated or not, characterize by oxidative burst, mitochondrial hyperpolarization, and LMP.**

> In conclusion, the cellular disintegration phase of the three types of necrosis (necroptosis, necrosis and secondary necrosis) is characterized by the same sequence of subcellular events, such as LMP, mitochondrial hyperpolarization, oxidative burst and eventually PMP. Moreover, the finding that LMP in apoptosis only occurs during the secondary necrosis phase may clarify the debate on the role and timing of LMP in apoptosis.
