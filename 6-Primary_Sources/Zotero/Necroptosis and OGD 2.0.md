Introduction
Ischemic diseases remain among the leading causes of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, representing a disease burden comparable to that of oncological disorders. Despite this, therapeutic options remain limited, with thrombolytic therapy being the only widely used clinical intervention. Although timely reperfusion can reduce tissue damage, extensive experimental and clinical evidence indicates that reperfusion itself can trigger additional injury. 
To address these limitations and dissect the underlying mechanisms, in vitro models of ischemia-reperfusion are particularly valuable due to their robustness, experimental controllability, and the ability to study selective cell types either alone or in defined combinations. Among these, oxygen–glucose deprivation followed by reperfusion (OGD/R) is a well-established in vitro model that reproduces key metabolic and hypoxic features of ischemic injury. Consequently, OGD/R has become a central experimental platform across multiple ischemia-related fields, including stroke[^7], retinal ischemia–reperfusion injury[^6], spinal cord injury[^8], glaucoma[^10], vascular dementia[^15], and intestinal and hepatic ischemia[^16,^30].

Cell loss during ischemia followed by reperfusion is a central component of ischemic pathogenesis and has long been a major focus of investigation. For years, apoptosis dominated the research on ischemic cell death. However, evidence suggests that caspase inhibition, while protective, does not completely prevent neuronal loss. This indicates that additional, caspase-independent mechanisms play a significant role in ischemia-related cell death[^2].  Profound alterations in cellular metabolism during ischemia, including depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and intracellular acidosis, shift the cell death program towards necroptosis, a regulated, caspase-independent cell death pathway.  

Necroptosis is a form of regulated cell death (RCD) that manifests morphologically as necrosis, characterized by cell swelling and permeabilization of the cellular membrane. According to the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (2018), necroptosis is defined as an RCD modality triggered by extracellular or intracellular perturbations of cellular homeostasis and dependent on the kinase activity of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and the pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL)[^1].

In this review, we focus on necroptosis as a central, yet context-dependent, form of regulated cell death in models of oxygen–glucose deprivation. We summarize current understanding of canonical and non-canonical necroptotic signaling pathways, and the conditions under which caspase-8 suppression becomes permissive rather than obligatory. By integrating molecular, cellular, and pathological perspectives, this review aims to clarify why necroptosis is prominently engaged in ischemic injury and to highlight its potential as a therapeutic target within salvageable tissue compartments.

## Why necroptosis is clinically significant

Despite necroptosis being detected in multiple ischemic-related conditions, its clinical relevance is most clearly illustrated in ischemic stroke. Dong and Xiong showed that during acute ischemic stroke in the intensive care unit, RIPK1 and RIPK3 serum levels positively correlate with the damage volume, the severity of the disease, and the poor prognosis.[^44] In addition, the apoptosis level in postmortem human specimens increased mainly in the core region, where MLKL increases both in the central and in the peri-infarct regions[^23].  The periphery of the lesion could be saved, which suggests that necroptosis is a valuable target. 

S1 spike glycoprotein subunits of SARS-CoV-2 can cross the blood-brain barrier and increase brain vulnerability to ischemia. Neuronal-like SH-SY5Y cells become more susceptible to ischemia, marked by activation of the necroptosis-related pathway through the overexpression of S1 spike subunits. vulnerability to ischemia.

The peri-infarct region corresponds to the ischemic penumbra, a metabolically compromised but potentially salvageable zone, highlighting necroptosis as a particularly attractive therapeutic target. Beyond direct cell loss, necroptosis has important inflammatory consequences. In contrast to apoptosis, where apoptotic bodies are rapidly cleared by phagocytes with minimal immune activation, necroptosis is characterized by plasma membrane rupture, lysosomal leakage, and release of intact intracellular components. This results in the liberation of highly immunogenic damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Moreover, during apoptosis, caspases cleave immunomodulatory molecules such as phospholipase A2 (PLA2), interleukin-33 (IL-33), and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), thereby limiting their inflammatory potential. Necroptosis, by contrast, lacks caspase activity, allowing the release of intact PLA2, IL-33, and HMGB1, which can further amplify secondary tissue damage.

## Molecular pathway
Necroptosis can be initiated by several receptors and innate immune sensors, including tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1). Among these, TNFR1-mediated necroptosis is the most extensively characterized. The binding of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) to TNFR1 can initiate three distinct signaling outcomes, depending on the molecular context.

The first and most common outcome is activation of pro-survival and inflammatory signaling through formation of Complex I. Complex I consists of TNF-receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), RIPK1, Cellular Inhibitors of Apoptosis 1 and 2 (cIAP1 and cIAP2), and the Linear Ubiquitin Chain Assembly Complex (LUBAC). Ubiquitination of RIPK1 by cIAPs and LUBAC stabilizes Complex I and creates a signaling platform that promotes activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.

Under conditions of severe cellular stress, such as ischemia, Complex I signaling can be disrupted. Deubiquitination of RIPK1 by the lysine 63–specific deubiquitinase CYLD facilitates the transition toward Complex II formation. When Complex II predominates, apoptotic signaling is initiated through caspase-8 (CASP8), which cleaves RIPK3 and functions as a critical checkpoint restraining necroptotic activation.

If CASP8 is inhibited or insufficient, the third pathway is activated, leading to necroptosis. RIPK1 and RIPK3 form the necrosome, followed by autophosphorylation or cross-phosphorylation of its components. This leads to the formation of amyloid-like structures and recruitment of the mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). Phosphorylation of MLKL at serine 358 in humans (Ser358) or serine 345 in mice (Ser345) promotes oligomerization and pore formation, disrupting membrane integrity and executing cell death through necroptosis. RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL are broadly accepted as the core components of necroptosis and are most extensively studied.

Upon activation, MLKL targets not only the plasma membrane but also multiple intracellular membrane-bound organelles, including lysosomes, nuclei, and mitochondria. Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction represents a critical downstream component of MLKL-mediated necroptosis. Wan and colleagues demonstrated that MLKL directly interacts with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1). Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of either MLKL or VDAC1 resulted in reduced intracellular calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, accompanied by marked suppression of necroptotic cell death. Dysregulated VDAC1 activity facilitates the release of cytochrome c, mitochondrial DNA, calcium, and ROS, thereby amplifying cellular stress responses. Based on these observations, the authors proposed that MLKL promotes VDAC1 oligomerization, leading to increased mitochondrial permeability and the establishment of a feed-forward loop that reinforces necroptotic signaling.[^47,^48]

In parallel to MLKL-dependent mechanisms, necroptotic execution can also proceed through calcium-dependent signaling pathways involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CaMKIIδ). CaMKIIδ is a serine/threonine kinase that integrates calcium signals and plays a critical role in cardiomyocyte injury through multiple death-associated pathways. Importantly, CaMKIIδ can mediate necroptotic execution independently of MLKL. Wang et al. demonstrated that during brain ischemia, both in vitro and in vivo, CaMKII activity increases in parallel with MLKL activation. Further mechanistic studies revealed that RIPK3 directly induces CaMKIIδ activation in both cardiomyocytes and cortical neurons. Activated CaMKIIδ promotes opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), leading to mitochondrial failure, calcium overload, and cell death. This pathway provides a direct link between RIPK3 activation and mitochondrial dysfunction, independent of canonical MLKL-mediated membrane permeabilization. Consistent with this model, Zhang et al. reported that in cardiomyocytes, RIPK3 and CaMKIIδ are essential for necroptotic cell death, whereas RIPK1 and MLKL are dispensable.

### Why necroptosis occurs during ischemia
#### CASP8 inactivation
In the context of ischemic injury, a central question is how caspase-8 (CASP8) activity becomes suppressed, thereby permitting necroptotic signaling. 
Because caspase activation and apoptotic execution are energy-dependent processes, metabolic failure is often considered a primary mechanism.  Ferrari et al. demonstrated that ATP reduction or inhibition of ATP production reduces apoptosis, but affects more receptor-independent pathways that do not interact with necroptosis. Although ATP depletion shifts the cell death pathway to more necrotic ones, for this shift to occur, the energy depletion has to be severe and prolonged, which may not be uniformly achieved across commonly used ischemic models. So ischemia-induced CASP8 inhibition must rely on other mechanisms. This suggests that ischemia-associated CASP8 suppression cannot be explained by energy deficiency alone and must involve additional regulatory mechanisms.

One such mechanism may be oxidative and/or nitrosative stress. Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) inhibits recombinant caspase-3 (CASP3) and CASP8 activity[^1]. Whereas low concentrations of H2O2 promote apoptosis, increased H2O2 concentration leads to significant caspase inhibition, and as a consequence, inhibits apoptosis[^3].  Consistently, combined exposure to hypothiocyanous acid and TNFα promotes necroptosis through functional inhibition of CASP8.[^2] Reactive nitrogen species further contribute to this effect: nitric oxide inhibits CASP8 via S-nitrosylation both in vitro and in vivo, either through NO donors or iNOS induction.  [^4] In addition, ROS promotes RIPK1 autophosphorylation and facilitates necrosome formation[]. However, reduction of ROS does not always affect the necroptosis pathway; butylated hydroxyanisole–mediated decrease of reactive oxygen species does not significantly affect necroptosis initiation.[^49][^50] The influence of ROS may be context- and cell-type-dependent.

Another possible way for ischemic cells to inhibit CASP8 is by low pH due to increased lactic acid, which shifts intracellular pH to a more acidic pH through anaerobic metabolism. Unfortunately, low pH does not impair CASP8 activity in endothelial cells, and CASP8 function in RIPK1 cleavage still remains. [^2] However, low pH induces necroptosis in neurons through acid-sensing ion channel 1a, which can promote it via channel-independent direct interaction with RIPK1. [] These observations further emphasize that CASP8 regulation during ischemia is neither uniform nor binary but depends on cell type and local microenvironmental conditions.

### CASP8-independent entry points: ZBP1 and PANoptotic integration
Although CASP8 is often described as a gatekeeper that suppresses necroptosis by limiting RIPK3 activation, necroptotic signalling does not always require profound CASP8 inactivation. One reason is the existence of RIPK1-independent entry points into the pathway, most notably Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1). ZBP1 is a cytosolic sensor of Z-conformation nucleic acids and contains RHIM (RIP homotypic interaction motif) domains that enable direct interaction with RHIM-containing partners such as RIPK3. Through this RHIM-mediated binding, ZBP1 can activate the RIPK3–MLKL axis without relying on canonical TNF/TNFR1-driven RIPK1 signalling, effectively providing an alternative upstream trigger for necroptosis.

This mechanism is best established in infection, where viral or endogenous Z-nucleic acids can engage ZBP1 to promote host defence-associated cell death. A similar logic may apply to ischemia, where mitochondrial injury is an early and prominent event. Mitochondria possess their own genome and are major sources of reactive oxygen species under hypoxic stress. Lin and colleagues reported that Z-DNA signals co-localise with mitochondria during early hypoxia and proposed that oxidative stress promotes Z-nucleic acid formation in susceptible genomic regions, including mitochondrial compartments. Consistent with this model, interventions targeting mitochondrial nucleic acids or mitochondrial ROS (e.g., ddV, a mitochondrial DNA scavenger, and MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant) attenuated ZBP1–RIPK3 signalling.[]

However, ZBP1 signalling is not uniformly pro-death, and this is where your section becomes genuinely interesting. In cardiomyocytes, Nobuyuki et al. reported that exposure to mitochondrial DNA can provoke inflammatory signalling without overt cell death, and that ZBP1 may exert protective effects by dampening RIPK3 and NLRP3 inflammasome activity, thereby limiting inflammatory escalation in myocardial infarction.[^1] In apparent contrast, Zhao’s group reported that myocardial infarction engages necroptotic signalling and that ZBP1 knockout reduces RIPK3/MLKL activation, consistent with a pro-necroptotic role for ZBP1 in that context.[^2] In addition, ZBP1 signalling is connected with PANoptosis, that combined pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. This combined pathway has been detected in multiple ischemic conditions, including hippocamal neurons [[@shuTargetingZbp1Ripk3Axis2025]]. So, the role of ZBP1 in ischemic conditions remains controversial and cell-type dependent. 

## Cell dependence of necroptosis 
Despite extensive investigation, there is no consensus on which cell types preferentially undergo necroptosis during ischemia–reperfusion injury. Evidence from neuronal, glial, and hepatic models reveals substantial discrepancies that likely reflect differences in cellular composition, differentiation state, and experimental context.

Meloni et al. showed that necrostatin-1 exerted only a small influence on the cell-survival rate in vitro, compared with an in vivo stroke model. They suggest this is due to a lack of necroptosis in cortical neurons, while glial cells are absent or present only at a bare minimum level and therefore lack sufficient TNFα secretion to promote the necroptosis pathway[^4]. However, the authors do not provide enough data to distinguish the type of cell death, and relatively new data available at the time of the publication of Meloni’s group states that necrostatin-1, as an inhibitor of RIPK1, not only represses the necroptosis cascade but also extrinsic apoptosis. Further support for a prominent glial role comes from Fan et al.[^8], who argued that MLKL, the key executor of necroptosis in the context of spinal-cord injury, is expressed mainly in microglia and astrocytes. On the other hand, Yang et al. demonstrated that ischemia triggers rapid, neuron-dominant necroptosis within the first 3 days. After 5 days, the predominant cell type undergoing necroptosis shifts to astrocytes[^22]. These data support the findings of Han et al., which state that pMLKL (the major executor of necroptosis) colocalizes primarily with NeuN-labeled neurons[^23].

Another contradiction in the data exists regarding necroptosis in hepatocytes. In 2025, Lin and colleagues state that hepatic ischemia-reperfusion specifically induced RIP3-dependent necroptosis in hepatocytes, rather than non-parenchymal cells, and knockout of RIP3 in hepatocytes or the use of RIP3 inhibitor significantly alleviated hepatocyte death.[[linZBP1sensedHypoxicStress2025]] The data are contradictory with the previous findings of Preston et al, hepatocytes, in contrast to other cells inside the liver, have poor expression of RIPK3 due to epigenetic silencing. Interestingly, if human-derived pluripotent cells do not undergo sufficient differentiation, they express a significant level of RIPK3 compared to differentiated ones. [[@prestonEpigeneticSilencingRIPK32022]] Which supported Saeed et al.'s evidence [[@saeedDoesNecroptosisHave2017]]. Collectively, these studies suggest that necroptotic engagement in the liver is not uniform but instead depends on cell type, differentiation state, and pathological context, highlighting the need for careful interpretation of necroptosis markers in hepatic ischemia–reperfusion models.

## Conclusion
Necroptosis has emerged as a major contributor to ischemic cell death, yet its engagement is neither uniform nor governed by a single linear pathway. Evidence from oxygen–glucose deprivation models indicates that necroptosis is best understood as a flexible, context-dependent program centered on RIPK3 signaling rather than as a RIPK1-dependent cascade. 

A key theme emerging from current literature is that caspase-8 suppression in ischemia is permissive rather than obligatory. Metabolic stress, oxidative and nitrosative modifications, and intracellular acidosis collectively weaken apoptotic control, creating conditions that favor necroptotic engagement without necessitating complete caspase inactivation. In parallel, RIPK1-independent mechanisms, most notably ZBP1-mediated sensing of endogenous nucleic acids, provide additional entry points into necroptotic and PANoptotic signaling networks. These pathways are particularly relevant in ischemia, where mitochondrial damage, reactive oxygen species, and inflammatory cues intersect.

Importantly, the contribution of necroptosis varies markedly across cell types, tissues, and temporal phases of ischemic injury. In the central nervous system, necroptotic susceptibility differs between neurons and glial cells and evolves over time, whereas in the liver, necroptotic competence appears strongly influenced by differentiation status and epigenetic regulation of RIPK3 expression. Such heterogeneity likely explains many of the apparent discrepancies reported across experimental models and underscores the necessity of precise cellular and molecular characterization when interpreting necroptosis-related findings.

Oxygen–glucose deprivation is particularly valuable for resolving cell-type-specific necroptotic responses, as it isolates metabolic stress from confounding systemic and inflammatory factors. Together, these findings argue that therapeutic strategies targeting necroptosis must be tailored to cell type, timing, and upstream signaling context rather than relying on uniform pathway inhibition.
