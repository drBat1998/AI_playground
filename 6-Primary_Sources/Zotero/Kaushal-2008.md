> After an ischemic stroke, neurons in the core are rapidly committed to die, whereas neuron death in the slowly developing penumbra is more amenable to therapeutic intervention. Microglia activation contributes to delayed inflammation, but because neurotoxic mechanisms in the penumbra are not well understood, we developed an in vitro model of microglia activation and propagated neuron killing. To recapitulate inflammatory triggers in the core, microglia were exposed to oxygen glucose-deprived neurons and astrocytes. To model the developing penumbra, the microglia were washed and allowed to interact with healthy naive neurons and astrocytes. We found that oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-stressed neurons released glutamate, which activated microglia through their group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Microglia activation involved nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), a transcription factor that promotes their proinflammatory functions. The activated microglia became neurotoxic, killing naive neurons through an apoptotic mechanism that was mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and involved activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-3. In contrast to some earlier models (e.g., microglia activation by lipopolysaccharide), neurotoxicity was not decreased by an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor (S-methylisothiourea) or a peroxynitrite scavenger [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methyl-4'-pyridyl)porphinato iron (III) chloride], and did not require p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. The same microglia neurotoxic behavior was evoked without exposure to OGD-stressed neurons, by directly activating microglial group II mGluRs with (2S,2'R,3'R)-2-(2'3'-dicarboxycyclopropyl) glycine or glutamate, which stimulated production of TNF-alpha (not nitric oxide) and mediated TNF-alpha-dependent neurotoxicity through activation of NF-kappaB (not p38 MAPK). Together, these results support potential therapeutic strategies that target microglial group II mGluRs, TNFalpha overproduction, and NF-kappaB activation to reduce neuron death in the ischemic penumbra.

  **Penumbra in case of ischemia is an area secondary damaged after initial neuronal and astrocytes cell death.**

> Microglial activation is observed within 1 d after a stroke in vivo (Schilling et al., 2003), but it has been difficult to identify the molecule(s) that activate the microglia. A prevalent theory is that damaged neurons release ATP (Volonte et al., 2003) and glutamate (Fujimoto et al., 2004), which activate microglial purinergic (Haynes et al., 2006) and glutamate (Taylor et al., 2002, 2005) receptors.

  **During stroke, damaged neurons initiate microglia activation. Well-known molecules such as NFkB and p38 promote TNFα secretion by microglia. This TNFa may lead to external apoptosis pathway initiation in "healthy neurons".**
