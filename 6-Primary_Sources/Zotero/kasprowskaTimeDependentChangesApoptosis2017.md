> Recent studies have implicated the role of autophagy in brain ischemia pathophysiology. However, it remains unclear whether autophagy activation is protective or detrimental to astrocytes undergoing ischemic stress. This study evaluated the influence of ischemia-induced autophagy on cell death and the course of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis in primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes exposed to combined oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The role of autophagy was assessed by pharmacological inhibition with 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Cell viability was evaluated by measuring LDH release and through the use of the alamarBlue Assay. Apoptosis and necrosis were determined by fluorescence microscopy after Hoechst 33,342 and propidium iodide staining, respectively. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. The downregulation of autophagy during OGD resulted in decreased cell viability and time-dependent changes in levels of apoptosis and necrosis. After short-term OGD (1, 4 h), cells treated with 3-MA showed higher level of cleaved caspase 3 compared with control cells. This result was consistent with an evaluation of apoptotic cell number by fluorescence microscopy. However, after prolonged exposure to OGD (8, 24 h), the number of apoptotic astrocytes (microscopically evaluated) did not differ or was even lower (as marked by caspase 3) in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor in comparison to the control. A higher level of necrosis was observed in 3-MA-treated cells compared to non-treated cells after 24 h OGD. The downregulation of autophagy caused time-dependent changes in both extrinsic (cleaved caspase 8, TNFα) and intrinsic (cleaved caspase 9) apoptotic pathways. Our results strongly indicate that the activation of autophagy in astrocytes undergoing ischemic stress is an adaptive mechanism, which allows for longer cell survival by delaying the initiation of apoptosis and necrosis.

> he 3-MA treatment resulted in a stronger reduction in cell survival in comparison to the control in cultures exposed to OGD for 4, 8, and 24 h (Fig. 2a). These results were confirmed by the measurement of LDH leakage, which was significantly higher in cells exposed to OGD in the presence of 3-MA after 8 and 24 h (Fig. 2b).
