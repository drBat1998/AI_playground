> Necroptosis is a crucial modality of programmed cell death characterized by distinct morphological and biochemical hallmarks, including cell membrane rupture, organelle swelling, cytoplasmic and nuclear disintegration, cellular contents leakage, and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), accompanied by the inflammatory responses. Studies have shown that necroptosis is involved in the etiology and evolution of a variety of pathologies including organ damage, inflammation disorders, and cancer. Despite its significance, the field of necroptosis research grapples with the challenge of non-standardized detection methodologies. In this review, we introduce the fundamental concepts and molecular mechanisms of necroptosis and critically appraise the principles, merits, and inherent limitations of current detection technologies. This endeavor seeks to establish a methodological framework for necroptosis detection, thereby propelling deeper insights into the research of cell necroptosis.

> Numerous evidences from genetic and  pharmacological studies suggest that necroptosis plays a crucial role in the occurrence, development and prognosis of viral infections [6], liver diseases [7], kidney injuries [8], neurodegenerative disorders [9], cardiovascular disease [10], ischemia-reperfusion injuries [11], inflammatory disease [12,13] and cancers [14].

> Although several RIPK3 small molecule inhibitors have been reported (such as GSK′872, GSK′843, and GSK′840), they suffer from a number of drawbacks, including high cytotoxicity, pronounced off-target effects, poor drug-forming properties, and the ability to induce RIPK3-dependent apoptosis [15,143,144].

> Francis Ka-Ming Chan’s team successfully monitored the necroptosis process of L929 cells using a live cell imaging system [65,66]. Douglas’s team at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital has utilized a live cell imaging system to monitor the effects of different time points and different inhibitors on necroptosis [67].
