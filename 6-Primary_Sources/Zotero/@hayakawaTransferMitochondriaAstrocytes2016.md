# Abstract 
Recently, it was suggested that neurons can release and transfer damaged
mitochondria to astrocytes for disposal and recycling . This ability to exchange mitochondria
may represent a potential mode of cell-cell signaling in the central nervous
system (CNS). Here, we show that astrocytes can also release functional
mitochondria that enter into neurons. Astrocytic release of extracellular
mitochondria particles was mediated by a calcium-dependent mechanism involving
CD38/cyclic ADP ribose signaling. Transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice
induced astrocytic mitochondria entry to adjacent neurons that amplified cell
survival signals. Suppression of CD38 signaling with siRNA reduced extracellular
mitochondria transfer and worsened neurological outcomes. These findings suggest
a new mitochondrial mechanism of neuroglial crosstalk that may contribute to
endogenous neuroprotective and neurorecovery mechanisms after stroke.

> If astrocytes can produce functional extracellular mitochondria, then is it possible that these signals may affect adjacent neurons? When rat cortical neurons were subjected to oxygenglucose deprivation, intracellular ATP levels fell and neuronal viability decreased, as expected (Fig. 2a–c, Extended Data Fig. 4). When astrocyte-conditioned media containing extracellular mitochondrial particles was added to neurons, ATP levels were increased and neuronal viability was recovered (Fig. 2a–c, Extended Data Fig. 4). But when extracellular mitochondria were removed from the astrocyte-conditioned media, neuroprotection was no longer observed (Fig. 2a–c, Extended Data Fig. 4).

# Notes

[[astrocytes share functional mitochondria with neurons during stroke model]]
Astrocytes rescue neuron after ischemic like condition, buy sharing functional mitochondria.
Ischemic condition reduce energy level in neurons and its volubility that leads to neurons death. Astrocyte-conditioned media rescue neurons from the condition, while extracellular mitochondria were removed from the media, neuroprotection was no longer observed. Hayakawa and colleagues indicated that the sharing of mitochondria occurs via CD38-mediated mechanisms. 

[[Could death-associated mitochondria promote death of nearby cells?]]
Could damaged, necroptosis associated mitochondria also be shared and promote cell death in near by cells?
