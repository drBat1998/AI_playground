# Abstract 
Precise regulation of cell death and survival is essential for proper maintenance of organismal homeostasis, development, and the immune system. Deregulated cell death can lead to developmental defects, neuropathies, infections, and cancer. Kidney diseases, especially acute pathologies linked to ischemia-reperfusion injury, are among illnesses that profoundly are affected by improper regulation or execution of cell death pathways. Attempts to develop medicines for kidney diseases have been impacted by the complexity of these pathologies given the heterogeneous patient population and diverse etiologies. By analyzing cell death pathways activated in kidney diseases, we attempt to differentiate their importance for these pathologies with a goal of identifying those that have more profound impact and the best therapeutic potential. Although classic apoptosis still might be important, regulated necrosis pathways including necroptosis, ferroptosis, parthanatos, and mitochondrial permeability transition-associated cell death play a significantly role in kidney diseases, especially in acute kidney pathologies. Although targeting receptor-interacting protein 1 kinase appears to be the best therapeutic strategy, combination with inhibitors of other cell death pathways is likely to bring superior benefit and possible cure to patients suffering from kidney diseases.

> In the mouse model of ischemic acute kidney injury, knockouts of Bax or Bak attenuated renal tubular cell apoptosis and partially protected from kidney injury without significantly affecting necrotic tubular damage.13,14 These results likely reflect the limited role of intrinsic apoptosis during ischemic acute kidney injury.

> However, TNF-related ligand TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is the most prominent TNF family member implicated in kidney pathologies.27 TWEAK’s role in kidney diseases stems from its ability to promote cell death and inflammatory response through the activation of canonical and noncanonical nuclear factor-κB as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.28,29 Currently, neutralizing anti-TWEAK antibodies are under investigation in clinical trials as a tissue protection strategy in lupus nephropathy.30 Interestingly, blocking extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways with pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD did not provide significant protection from organ damage or an increase in urea and creatinine levels in vivo in renal ischemia reperfusion injury.31 Therefore, the effect observed with neutralization of TNF family ligands and/or receptors might be attributed to a blunted inflammatory response rather than to the impairment of caspase activation.

> Similarly, animals deficient for RIP3 also are greatly protected from ischemia-reperfusion injury.45 In the animal kidney transplantation model, recipients that received kidneys from RIP3 knockouts had longer survival and improved renal function compared with controls, thus indicating that RIP3-mediated necroptosis and other death signaling in donor kidneys can promote inflammatory injury.46

> In support of that hypothesis, renal ischemia-reperfusion injury induces increased expression of caspase-1, caspase-11, and IL-1β, concomitantly with increased renal structural and functional injury.53 Future studies with selective caspase-11 inhibitors and caspase-1/11 double-knockout mice are needed to fully understand the contribution of pyroptosis to IRI.
