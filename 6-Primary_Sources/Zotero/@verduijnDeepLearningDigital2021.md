> Regulated cell death modalities such as apoptosis and necroptosis play an important role in regulating different cellular processes. Currently, regulated cell death is identified using the golden standard techniques such as fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. However, they require fluorescent labels, which are potentially phototoxic. Therefore, there is a need for the development of new label-free methods. In this work, we apply Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) coupled with a deep learning algorithm to distinguish between alive, apoptotic and necroptotic cells in murine cancer cells. This method is solely based on label-free quantitative phase images, where the phase delay of light by cells is quantified and is used to calculate their topography. We show that a combination of label-free DHM in a high-throughput set-up (~10,000 cells per condition) can discriminate between apoptosis, necroptosis and alive cells in the L929sAhFas cell line with a precision of over 85%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time deep learning in the form of convolutional neural networks is applied to distinguish-with a high accuracy-apoptosis and necroptosis and alive cancer cells from each other in a label-free manner. It is expected that the approach described here will have a profound impact on research in regulated cell death, biomedicine and the field of (cancer) cell biology in general.

### Ideas, thoughts, useful information

  **So, the author <b>used</b> digital holographic microscopy and <b>high-content imaging</b> to <b>distinguish</b> apoptosis and necroptosis without adding any cytotoxicity. Also, <b>it's an</b> interesting approach, <b>but</b> it has multiple <b>disadvantages</b>. First, you <b>need an additional</b> camera for digital holography. Second, they chose only two from the spectrum of different cell death types. Third, I can't recall <b>a test of the DL method</b> in other cell lines.**

Digital holographic microsopy with deep learning also may be a valuble addition to high content screening approch. However, this approach has identical problem to 

[[HTI and regulated necrosis]]

  **What is the digital holographic microscopy?
Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) records interference patterns of light and reconstructs them digitally to create 3D, label-free images of transparent samples.
It’s cool because it gives real-time, quantitative data on live cells without staining or phototoxicity.
Its downside is that it’s highly sensitive to vibrations and speckle noise, and the reconstruction math can feel like punishment for studying biology.**
