> This study aimed to systematically investigate whether programmed necrosis contributes to H2 O2 -induced nucleus pulposus (NP) cells death and to further explore the underlying mechanism involved. Rat NP cells were subjected to different concentrations of H2 O2 for various time periods. The cell viability was measured using a cell counting kit-8, and the death rate was detected by Hoechst 33258/propidium iodide (PI) staining. The programmed necrosis-related molecules receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. The morphologic and ultrastructural changes were examined by phasecontrast microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, the necroptosis inhibitor Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), the PARP inhibitor diphenyl-benzoquinone (DPQ) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology were used to indirectly evaluate programmed necrosis. Our results indicated that H2 O2 induced necrotic morphologic and ultrastructural changes and an elevated PI positive rate in NP cells; these effects were mediated by the upregulation of RIP1 and RIP3, hyperactivation of PARP, and translocation of AIF from mitochondria to nucleus. Additionally, NP cells necrosis was significantly attenuated by Nec-1, DPQ pretreatment and knockdown of RIP3 and AIF, while knockdown of RIP1 produced the opposite effects. In conclusion, these results suggested that under oxidative stress, RIP1/RIP3-mediated programmed necrosis, executed through the PARP-AIF pathway, played an important role in NP cell death. Protective strategies aiming to regulate programmed necrosis may exert a beneficial effect for NP cells survival, and ultimately retard intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

> Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (DCm) Analysis  As previously reported, DCm changes in NP cells was revealed by 5,50,6,60-tetrachloro-1,10,3,30-tetraethylbenzimidazolycarbocyanine iodide (JC-1, Beyotime, China) staining.5 NP cells were harvested and incubated in culture medium that contained JC-1 reagent for 20 min at 37 ̊C in the dark. Subsequently, the cells were washed with ice-cold staining buffer, resuspended in medium and analyzed by FCM. The values of DCm were expressed as the ratio of red fluorescence intensity to green fluorescence intensity. For the detection of DCm in situ, the NP cells were cultured in Petri dishes and stained for 30 min as depicted above. Finally, the cells were observed under a LSM.

> PARP Activity Assay  The PARP activity in NP cells was measured using the PARP Universal Colorimetric Assay (Trevigen Inc., R&D Systems, Lille, France) following the manufacturer’s protocol. NP cells were collected and lysed in PARP buffer that contained a mixture of 1% Triton X-100 and proteases inhibitors. The protein concentration was detected with Bradford assay. Then, cells lysates were used to determine the incorporation of biotinylated PAR onto histone proteins coated in a 96-well plate by measurement of the absorbance at 450 nm. PARP activity was represented as arbitrary units.

> In this study, our group discovered that H2O2 induced necrotic morphological changes, decreased cell viability and increased cell necrosis ratio in NP cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1 can reverse these changes to a great extent. Highly consistent with the above results, the examination of NP cell ultrastructure exhibited typical indications of necrosis,

> and Nec-1 almost reversed the ultrastructural collapse of the NP cells. Meanwhile, the mRNA and protein expression levels of RIP1 and RIP3 both increased with H2O2 concentration. Taken together, these results demonstrate that RIP1/RIP3-dependent necroptosis is extremely likely to be involved in H2O2induced NP cell death. As for the different trends of RIP1 and RIP3 expression, we speculate that this may be due to the multiple functions of RIP1 and RIP3 in cell physiology and pathology.

> It is known that the classical RIP1-RIP3-MLKL signal pathway plays a vitally important role in necroptosis.44 In addition, other atypical pathways, such as the RIP1-dependent, RIP3-dependent, and RIP3-MLKL pathways, can mediate necroptosis.45–47 To further clarify the typical pathway involved in H2O2-induced necroptosis, the activated forms of RIP1 and RIP3, namely, phosphorylated RIP1 and RIP3, were also measured. The results indicated that the  protein levels of p-RIP1 and p-RIP3 both increased significantly. Moreover, we applied RIP1-siRNA and RIP3-siRNA in our experiment. In coordination with expectations, the knockdown of RIP3 can effectively reduce the level of necroptosis. However, the knockdown of RIP1 induced higher cell viability loss and cell death rates. It may be attributed to the other basic function of RIP1, which can activate NF-kB signaling pathway to facilitate cell survival.48 We speculate that the higher cell viability loss and cell death rate caused by RIP1-siRNA may result from the deletion of the pro-survival NF-kB signaling. That is to say, overexpression of RIP1 may lead to cell death, whereas normal expression of RIP1 may lead to cell survival. This subject merits more detailed investigation in our subsequent studies. Besides, the apoptosis-related makers were evaluated to more extensively identify necroptosis. The results verified the involvement of apoptosis in H2O2-induced NP cells death, and
