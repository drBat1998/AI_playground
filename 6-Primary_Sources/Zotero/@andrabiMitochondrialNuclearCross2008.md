> Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is an abundant nuclear protein best known to facilitate DNA base excision repair. Recent work has expanded the physiologic functions of PARP-1, and it is clear that the full range of biologic actions of this important protein are not yet fully understood. Regulation of the product of PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), is a dynamic process with PAR glycohydrolase playing the major role in the degradation of the polymer. Under pathophysiologic situations overactivation of PARP-1 results in unregulated PAR synthesis and widespread neuronal cell death. Once thought to be necrotic cell death resulting from energy failure, we have found that PARP-1-dependent cell death is dependent on the generation of PAR, which triggers the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor resulting in caspase-independent cell death. This form of cell death is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy and is termed parthanatos. PARP-1-dependent cell death has been implicated in tissues throughout the body and in diseases afflicting hundreds of millions worldwide, including stroke, Parkinson's disease, heart attack, diabetes, and ischemia reperfusion injury in numerous tissues. The breadth of indications for PARP-1 injury make parthanatos a clinically important form of cell death to understand and control.

  **PARP1 is poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases, so the main function is to transfer ADP-ribose group to acceptor proteins**

  **PARP1 uses energy from NAD+ to transfer polymers of ADP-ribose on different acceptor proteins or PARP1 itself**

  **In physiological circumstances, PARP1 plays an important role in DNA damage repair, but during significant stress, excessive poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation due to massive DNA disruption leads to cell death.**

> The biochemical features of Parthanatos are distinct from classically defined pathways of cell death and include rapid PARP-1 activation, early PAR accumulation, mitochondrial depolarization, early nuclear AIF translocation, loss of cellular NAD and ATP, and late caspase activation 17-19

  **Poly (ADP-ribose) Glycohydrolase (PARG) protects against PARP1 dependent cell death.**

> . Recently, we demonstrated that overexpression of cytosolic PARG results in cyto-protection against PARP-1 dependent cell death and Parthanatos 17. Delivery of purified PAR induces cell death in HeLa cells and mouse primary neurons. Predigestion of PAR with recombinant PARG protects against PAR-mediated cell death 17.
