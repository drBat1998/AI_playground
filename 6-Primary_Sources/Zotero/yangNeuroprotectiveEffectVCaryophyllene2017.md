> Necrotic cell death is a hallmark feature of ischemic stroke and it may facilitate inflammation by releasing intracellular components after cell-membrane  rupture. Previous studies reported that β-caryophyllene (BCP) mitigates cerebral  ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear.  We explored whether BCP exerts a neuroprotective effect in cerebral I/R injury  through inhibiting necroptotic cell death and inflammation. Primary neurons with  and without BCP (0.2, 1, 5, 25 μM) treatment were exposed to oxygen-glucose  deprivation and re-oxygenation (OGD/R). Neuron damage, neuronal death type and  mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein expression were assessed 48 h  after OGD/R. Furthermore, mice underwent I/R procedures with or without BCP (8,  24, 72 mg/kg, ip.). Neurologic dysfunction, cerebral infarct volumes, cell death,  cytokine levels, necroptosis core molecules, and HMGB1-TLR4 signaling were  determined at 48 h after I/R. BCP (5 μM) significantly reduced necroptotic  neurons and MLKL protein expression following OGD/R. BCP (24, 72 mg/kg, ip.)  reduced infarct volumes, neuronal necrosis, receptor-interaction protein kinase-1  (RIPK1), receptor-interaction protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) expression, and MLKL  phosphorylation after I/R injury. BCP also decreased high-mobility group box 1  (HMGB1), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis  factor-α (TNF-α) levels. Thus, BCP alleviates ischemic brain damage potentially  by inhibiting necroptotic neuronal death and inflammatory response. This study  suggests a novel application for BCP as a neuroprotective agent.
