> As a common and severe cerebrovascular disease, ischemic stroke casts a significant shadow over global health. Unfortunately, the mechanisms regulating neuronal death in the affected areas remain largely unclear. Here, we found that deletion of the deubiquitinating enzyme Otubain-2 (OTUB2) significantly alleviated ischemia-induced cerebral infarction and neurological deficits, accompanied by a reduction in neuronal loss, glial activation, and neuroinflammation. OTUB2 was predominantly expressed in neurons and its deletion decreased receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-mediated neuronal necroptosis. Moreover, OTUB2 increased RIPK3 protein abundance by inhibiting the proteasomal degradation of RIPK3. Mechanistically, OTUB2 removed K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIPK3 through its active site C51. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of OTUB2 alleviated ischemic brain injury in mice and reduced oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced neuronal death in human brain organoids. These results demonstrate that OTUB2 critically regulates ischemic stroke injury by potentiating neuronal necroptosis, suggesting that OTUB2 inhibition may become a potential therapeutic approach for treating ischemic stroke.

> For example, decoration of RIPK1 by M1- and K63linked polyubiquitin chains diverts the downstream cell death signaling to pro-survival and pro-inflammatory NF-κB signaling (Ai et al, 2024; Mahoney et al, 2008). Besides, physiological ubiquitination of RIPK3 at K5 supports the formation of RIPK1RIPK3 complexes and thereby promotes necroptosis (Onizawa et al, 2015). Ubiquitination is a reversible process that is catalyzed by E1, E2, and E3 ubiquitinating enzymes and counter-regulated by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) (Huang et al, 2024; Ruan et al, 2022).

> In the present study, we found that the DUB OTUB2 enhanced cerebral ischemic injury by increasing RIPK3-mediated neuronal necroptosis. Moreover, genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of OTUB2 significantly ameliorated ischemic stroke injury, suggesting that OTUB2 inhibition may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for ischemic stroke

> Multiple E3 ligases, including PELI1, TRIM11, TRIM25, and CHIP (Choi et al, 2018; Mei et al, 2021; Seo et al, 2016; Xie et al, 2020), can ubiquitinate RIPK3 for degradation in the proteasome or  lysosome. In the current study, we found that OTUB2 removed K48-specific polyubiquitination from RIPK3 and thereby inhibited its proteasomal degradation, which is consistent with previous reports that RIPK3 is degraded by the proteasome after K48 ubiquitination (Choi et al, 2018; Mei et al, 2021). Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, OTUB2 is the first DUB that has been shown to stabilize RIPK3, enriching the regulatory mechanism for necroptosis.
