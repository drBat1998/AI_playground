# Abstract 
RIPK3 amyloid complex plays crucial roles during TNF-induced necroptosis and in response to immune defense in both human and mouse. Here, we have structurally characterized mouse RIPK3 homogeneous self-assembly using solid-state NMR, revealing a well-ordered N-shaped amyloid core structure featured with 3 parallel in-register β-sheets. This structure differs from previously published human RIPK1/RIPK3 hetero-amyloid complex structure, which adopted a serpentine fold. Functional studies indicate both RIPK1-RIPK3 binding and RIPK3 amyloid formation are essential but not sufficient for TNF-induced necroptosis. The structural integrity of RIPK3 fibril with three β-strands is necessary for signaling. Molecular dynamics simulations with a mouse RIPK1/RIPK3 model indicate that the hetero-amyloid is less stable when adopting the RIPK3 fibril conformation, suggesting a structural transformation of RIPK3 from RIPK1-RIPK3 binding to RIPK3 amyloid formation. This structural transformation would provide the missing link connecting RIPK1-RIPK3 binding to RIPK3 homo-oligomer formation in the signal transduction.

It would be interesting to see the structural details of the pure RIPK3 amyloid and whether it can adopt structures similar to those of RIPK1/RIPK3 complexes.

> great similarities to the human RIPK1/RIPK3 hetero-amyloid. The results indicate that lower stability for a hetero-amyloid to adopt the conformation as mouse RIPK3 homo-amyloid. These findings suggest the mouse RIPK1/ RIPK3 hetero-amyloid would undergo a structural transformation from the hetero-oligomer formed upon RIPK1–RIPK3 interaction to the RIPK3 self-assembly if the structure of the hypothetical hetero-amyloid is similar to the real mouse RIPK1/RIPK3 heteroamyloid.

> How does necroptosis signal transit from upstream RHIMcontaining factors to RIPK3? Comparing the fibril structures of human RIPK1/RIPK3 and mouse RIPK3, we found the conformation of the 4-conserved residues I(V)QI(V/L)G in the second βstrand are nearly identical (Fig. 8b). It suggests the tetrad sequence of RIPK1 or other upstream RHIM-containing factors will fold as amyloidal nucleates to recruit the second β-strand of RIPK3 first. Consistently, mutations to replace the 4-conserved residues of either upstream factors including RIPK1 and TRIF or RIPK3 (Fig. 7a) will prevent the RIPK3 recruitment and cell necroptosis3,30,31. Then, the second β-strand of RIPK3 RHIM behaves as the amyloid core, to induce the stacking of the first and the third β-strand to form a unique “N”-shaped structure (Fig. 8e). The RIPK3 mutations (F442D, Q449D, and L456D) that destabilize the fibril or delay the fibril formation would prevent the cell necroptosis.

From these study the RIPK3 formation of amyloid-like structure is essential for necroptosis, and the RIPK1-RIPK3 complex plays a role as a nucleus to start the amyloid formation. Interestingly, the RIPK3 amyloid structure is more stable.
