> Necroptosis initiation relies on the receptor-interacting protein 1 kinase (RIP1K). We recently reported that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of RIP1K produces protection against ischemic stroke-induced astrocytic injury. However, the role of RIP1K in ischemic stroke-induced formation of astrogliosis and glial scar remains unknown. Here, in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rat model and an oxygen and glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/Re)-induced astrocytic injury model, we show that RIP1K was significantly elevated in the reactive astrocytes. Knockdown of RIP1K or delayed administration of RIP1K inhibitor Nec-1 down-regulated the glial scar markers, improved ischemic stroke-induced necrotic morphology and neurologic deficits, and reduced the volume of brain atrophy. Moreover, knockdown of RIP1K attenuated astrocytic cell death and proliferation and promoted neuronal axonal generation in a neuron and astrocyte co-culture system. Both vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) and its receptor VEGFR-3 were elevated in the reactive astrocytes; simultaneously, VEGF-D was increased in the medium of astrocytes exposed to OGD/Re. Knockdown of RIP1K down-regulated VEGF-D gene and protein levels in the reactive astrocytes. Treatment with 400 ng/ml recombinant VEGF-D induced the formation of glial scar; conversely, the inhibitor of VEGFR-3 suppressed OGD/Re-induced glial scar formation. RIP3K and MLKL may be involved in glial scar formation. Taken together, these results suggest that RIP1K participates in the formation of astrogliosis and glial scar via impairment of normal astrocyte responses and enhancing the astrocytic VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 signaling pathways. Inhibition of RIP1K promotes the brain functional recovery partially via suppressing the formation of astrogliosis and glial scar.

> Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation (OGD)/Reoxygenation (OGD/Re)  For OGD treatment, the astrocytes were washed with 0.01 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS), incubated in serum- and glucosefree DMEM (GIBCO, 11966), placed in a humidified hypoxia chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, CA, USA), and flushed with mixed gas (95% N2/5% CO2) for 10 min to remove the oxygen and then incubated in the sealed hypoxia chamber (BillupsRothenberg, CA, USA) for 6 h at 37 °C. For OGD/Re, cells were taken out of the chamber following OGD, transferred to the regular cell culture incubator, and incubated with complete medium. Control cells were incubated in complete medium and received similar wash steps as OGD/Re-treated cells in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To induce RIP1K knockdown in astrocytes, lentiviruses with shRNA RIP1K or with scr shRNA were added to the 3rd passage of the astrocytes. Nec-1 (Selleck, S8037) at 100 μM, GSK′872 (MCE, HY101872) at 10 μM, Necrosulfonamide (NSA) (MCE, HY100573) at 1 μM, or SAR131675 (MCE, HY-15458) at 20 nM was added to the cells upon reoxygenation.
