> The role of ferroptosis in steatohepatitis development is largely unknown. We investigated (1) whether hepatocyte ferroptosis occurs in a gene-modified steatohepatitis model without modifying dietary components, (2) whether ferroptosis occurs at an early stage of steatohepatitis, and (3) whether apomorphine, recently reported as a ferroptosis inhibitor, can ameliorate steatohepatitis. Hepatocyte-specific PTEN KO mice were used. Huh 7 and primary cultured hepatocytes isolated from the mice were used in this study. The number of dead cells increased in 10-week-old PTEN KO mice. This cell death was suppressed by the administration of ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 for 2 weeks. Apomorphine also ameliorated the severity of steatohepatitis. Treatment with ferroptosis inhibitors, including apomorphine, decreases the level of lipid peroxidase. Apomorphine suppressed cell death induced by RSL-3 (a ferroptosis inducer), which was not suppressed by apoptosis or necroptosis inhibitors. Apomorphine showed a radical trapping capacity with much more potent activity than ferrostatin-1 and Trolox, a soluble form of vitamin E. In addition, apomorphine activated nrf2 and its downstream genes, including HO-1 and xCT. In conclusion, ferroptosis occurs in steatohepatitis from an early stage in PTEN KO mice. In addition, apomorphine ameliorates the severity of steatohepatitis by inhibiting ferroptosis.

  **The author claimed apoptpsis and necroptosis are associated with last stage of steatohepatitis.**

  **PTEN knockdown is a well-known model of steatohepatitis. Due to oxidative stress caused by the dysregulation of PTEN, the majority of cells choose ferroptosis over other regulated cell death types.**

  **[[What is the Flox mice?]]
Floxed mice (short for <b>flanked by loxP</b>) are genetically engineered mice that carry specific DNA sequences flanked by <b>loxP sites</b>—short palindromic sequences recognized by the Cre recombinase enzyme.

[[flanked]]
<b>Flanked</b> means <b>surrounded or bordered on both sides</b> by something. In the context of <b>floxed mice</b>, a gene is <b>flanked</b> by <b>loxP sites</b>—meaning that two loxP sequences are positioned <b>on either side</b> of the target gene. This allows the <b>Cre recombinase</b> enzyme to recognize and modify the DNA sequence between them.**
