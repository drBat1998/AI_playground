> abstract:: BACKGROUND: Aging is a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke and worsens its outcome. However, the mechanisms for this worsened neurological outcome with aging are not clearly defined.
RESULTS: Old C57BL/6J male mice (18 to 20 months old) had a poorer neurological outcome and more severe inflammation after transient focal brain ischemia than 8-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (young mice). Young mice with transplantation of old mouse gut microbiota had a worse neurological outcome, poorer survival curve, and more severe inflammation than young mice receiving young mouse gut microbiota transplantation. Old mice and young mice transplanted with old mouse gut microbiota had an increased level of blood valeric acid. Valeric acid worsened neurological outcome and heightened inflammatory response including blood interleukin-17 levels after brain ischemia. The increase of interleukin-17 caused by valeric acid was inhibited by a free fatty acid receptor 2 antagonist. Neutralizing interleukin-17 in the blood by its antibody improved neurological outcome and attenuated inflammatory response in mice with brain ischemia and receiving valeric acid. Old mice transplanted with young mouse feces had less body weight loss and better survival curve after brain ischemia than old mice transplanted with old mouse feces or old mice without fecal transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the gut microbiota-valeric acid-interleukin-17 pathway contributes to the aging-related changes in the outcome after focal brain ischemia and response to stimulus. Valeric acid may activate free fatty acid receptor 2 to increase interleukin-17.
