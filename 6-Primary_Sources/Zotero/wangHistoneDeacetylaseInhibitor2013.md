> Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are novel anticancer reagents that have recently been reported to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects; however, the mechanisms underlying their activities are largely undefined. The data from this study show that the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) can protect L929 cells from TNFα-induced necroptosis. This effect involves multiple mechanisms, including the upregulation of cFLIPL expression, the enhanced activation of NFκB and p38 MAPK, and the inactivation of JNK. In addition, SAHA could initiate cell autophagy by inhibiting Akt and mTOR, which also play important roles in protecting cells from necroptosis. Because cell necroptosis is important for inflammation-related deterioration and neurodegenerative disease, our results indicate that preventing cell necrosis may be an important mechanism through which HDAC inhibitor compounds exert their anti-inflammatory or neuroprotective effects.

> However, instead of killing the cells, SAHA and rapamycin, a known autophagy initiator, induced autophagy, which could protect the cells from TNFa-induced necroptosis. However, the reported effects of autophagy on necroptosis are inconsistent even in the same cell type (L929 cells). One study reported that z-VAD could enhance necroptosis by initiating autophagy [64] and another suggested that the inhibition of autophagy could promote cell necrosis [33]. In contrast, other studies have reported that initiating autophagy could protect cells from necrosis [65, 66]. Our data indicate that SAHA protects L929 cells from TNFa-induced necroptosis by inhibiting Akt and its downstream mTOR activity and initiating autophagy.
