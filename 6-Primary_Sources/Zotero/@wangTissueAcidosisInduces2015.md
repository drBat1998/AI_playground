> Acidotoxicity is common among neurological disorders, such as ischemic stroke. Traditionally, Ca(2+) influx via homomeric acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) was considered to be the leading cause of ischemic acidotoxicity. Here we show that extracellular protons trigger a novel form of neuronal necroptosis via ASIC1a, but independent of its ion-conducting function. We identified serine/threonine kinase receptor interaction protein 1 (RIP1) as a critical component of this form of neuronal necroptosis. Acid stimulation recruits RIP1 to the ASIC1a C-terminus, causing RIP1 phosphorylation and subsequent neuronal death. In a mouse model of focal ischemia, middle cerebral artery occlusion causes ASIC1a-RIP1 association and RIP1 phosphorylation in affected brain areas. Deletion of the Asic1a gene significantly prevents RIP1 phosphorylation and brain damage, suggesting ASIC1a-mediated RIP1 activation has an important role in ischemic neuronal injury. Our findings indicate that extracellular protons function as a novel endogenous ligand that triggers neuronal necroptosis during ischemia via ASIC1a independent of its channel function.

> Because our culture system lacks phagocytes, we measured caspase activities to evaluate the possible involvement of secondary necrosis following apoptosis (Berghe et al., 2010). Although the activity of caspase 8 was moderately increased 4 and 8 hr after the pH 6.0 treatment (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), that of executive apoptosis effectors, caspase 3/7, did not increase (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-E). Rather, caspase 3/7 activities decreased slightly at 4 hr (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) and the cleavage of caspase 3 (activated caspase 3) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E) was undetectable by Western blotting. These data, together with the result that pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk failed to block pH 6.0-induced neuronal death (Figure 1B, Figure 1—figure supplement 1F), suggest that acid triggers necrotic neuronal death but not apoptosis under the current experimental conditions.

> ell viability was assessed by the Cell Titer Blue (CTB) assay. As reported previously (Xiong et al., 2004), the ASIC1a specific inhibitor, psalmotoxin (PcTX1), attenuated acid-induced neuronal death. To our surprise, however, inhibiting RIP1 phosphorylation (Figure 2A,B) by Nec-1 (Degterev et al., 2005) also resulted in a similar protective effect (IC50, 12.6 μM, Figure 1B; CTB assay). Unlike PcTX1, up to 30 min pretreatment with Nec-1 did not affect the acid (pH 6.0)-evoked currents (I6.0) in the neurons (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A).

> A previous report showed that inhibitors of acid-induced neuronal death also suppressed ROS generation (Liu et al., 2009), implying a potential pro-necrotic effect of ROS (Vandenabeele et al., 2010) on acid-induced necrosis. However, the pH 6.0 treatment resulted in no obvious change in ROS levels in the neurons (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) and neither scavenging ROS by anti-oxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) nor blockade of ROS production by rotenone (RTO) or diphenylene iodonium (DPI) rescued neurons from acid-induced death (Figure 1B). These results indicate that ROS production is not necessary for acid-induced cell death, consistent with the previous finding (Xiong et al., 2004). Also, earlier reports showed that extracellular protons led to intracellular Ca2+ elevation (Xiong et al., 2004; Yermolaieva et al., 2004), which is one of the major causes of conventional necrotic cell death. Besides enhancing mitochondrial ROS production through activation of key enzymes of the Krebs cycle, Ca2+ also triggers cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2)-mediated necrosis (Vandenabeele et al., 2010). However, a cPLA2 inhibitor, bromoenol lactone (BEL), failed to protect neurons from acid-induced death (Figure 1B). Removing Ca2+ from the treatment solution also had no clear protective effect in the present study (Figure 3D). The above results, thus, suggest that acidinduced neuronal death involves a form of RIP1-mediated necrosis which is independent of ROS and Ca2+. Consistent with this idea, recent evidence showed that RIP1 was not involved in certain forms of intrinsic necrosis induced by ROS generators or Ca2+ ionophores (Sun et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012).

> Moreover, despite similar extracellular acid-induced intracellular acidification between neurons from Asic1a+/+ (wild type, WT) and Asic1a−/− mice (Figure 2D1,D2), only WT, but not Asic1a−/−, neurons showed enhanced RIP1 phosphorylation in response to the extracellular pH reduction (Figure 2C), suggesting that the presence of ASIC1a proteins rather than intracellular acidification was necessary for such a response.

> aken together, these results suggest that acid-induced neuronal death is a programmed form of RIP1-dependent necrosis, or necroptosis (Degterev et al., 2005; Linkermann and Green, 2014), which is dependent on the physical association of RIP1 with ASIC1a

> To evaluate the possibility that acid-induced necroptosis arose from autocrine production of cytokines, we first tested whether de novo protein synthesis was required for cell death and found that the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) failed to protect neurons from acid-induced death (Figure 1B). Second, we used the TNF-α neutralizing antibody but found that it failed to rescue neurons from acid-induced death, while it was effective in protecting neurons from TNF-α-induced death (Figure 2I, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Therefore, it is unlikely that any pro-necrotic protein production is involved in acidinduced necrotic cell death.

> The inability to activate RIP1 probably explains the resistance of Asic1a−/− mice to ischemic brain damage. These findings, altogether, strongly suggest ASIC1a is an important up-stream factor regulating RIP1 in vivo. Because both ASIC1a and RIP1 are widely expressed in nervous systems (Degterev et al., 2005; Wemmie et al., 2006) and tissue acidosis is a common feature of many neurological diseases, this novel DR-independent necroptosis probably contributes to neuronal injury in a broad range of neurological disorders. 

[[low pH and necroptosis]]
Acidosis is a significant part of ischemic pathogenesis, and of it overlay with necroptosis.  Acid-sensing ion channel 1a that detect acidosis inside the brain promotes necroptosis by direct contact and RIPK1 phosphorylation and not ionic conduction.
