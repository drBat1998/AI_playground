# Notes
Planning for bioimage analysis
1. Determine what needs to be measured
2. Determine a suitable microscope technique
3. Sample preparation
4. Image acquisition
5. Quantification

Run a pilot study

During acquisition
- sufficient sampling rate
	- object size
	- [[Nyquist Sampling]]
- avoid saturation
- use proper bit depth
	- 2^16
- use the whole dynamic range 
- appropriate resolution
