# Notes
1. The locomotive effect states that the subject and the verb have to be at the start of difficult sentences.
2. Enallage is the deliberate mistake used as a hook for a reader, but for me, it is too early to use it.
3. Writing at a 5th-grade reading level is a way to simplify your writing to be understood by a broader audience. However, it is also true that the words that you choose and the style of your writing tell your reader a bunch of important insights about you. 
4. Don't be afraid of both difficult and easy words. Moreover, collect interesting phrases and words and try to incorporate them into your style.
5. Use words to change a perspective to other words. Juxtaposition (when two words located nearby improve each other) and Irony.
6. Alliteration - You may use words that start with one word to increase the memorability of the word. 
7. Move up and down the Ladder of Abstraction
8. Polyptoton - using the same word in different parts of speech
9. Antithesis - state both the negative and the positive sides. Familiar idea fleep with another way.
10. Writing is a communication; writing is to enter the conversation. 
11. Ability to mix senses, smell with abstract, synesthesia. 
12. Diacope - repeat the word. 
13. Peolepsis - start with a pronoun, the subject does not state previously.
