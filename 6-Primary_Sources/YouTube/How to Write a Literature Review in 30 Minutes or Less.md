# Notes
What the bleep is a literature review? Why should I care?
Even if you didn't work in academia, having a solid understanding and skills in literature review may have a bunch of benefits. For example, David Taylor states that for some HR managers to have a valid conclusion and data-driven behavior is an essential part of their work. 

Gather literature. Make a summary that consists of source citations and a detailed summary. 
5 steps to make a good literature review
1. Strip the summaries. Save a list of references in a separate part. Make your summaries in alphabetical order. Each summary starts with an in-text citation (Frisoli uses, Backers et al. examine), and all information downside of the paragraph should refer to the article (The authors present, the article can be used).
2. Reorder paragraphs. Reread all paragraph summaries, find similarities and differences, reorder paragraphs into logical list based on conncections you find. Example of posible conections are cause-effect, problem-solution, series of advances, myths-realities, ancient-modern, effective-ineffective. 
3. Combine paragraphs if necessary
4. Add topic sentences and transitions
5. Add introduction and conclusion.
