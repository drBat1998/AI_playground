# Notes
Stock solution
1. Check the technical datasheet that goes with the primers
2. Find "ul for 100uM" column
3. Spean Eppendorf with primers
4. Add ul ddH2O that is assigned in the column to make the stock solution
5. Vortex for at least 10 seconds
6. centrifuge 
7. stored in -20C
Work solution (10uM)
1. Allow the stock solution to thaw completely at Room temperature
2. While waiting for your stock to thaw, prepare clean microcentrifuge tubes by labeling them with the primer name and date of preparation. Label the lid so it is easy to identify tubes in freezer box.
3. Vortex the stock solution for at least 00:00:10 to ensure homogenization before adding it to the working solution. 
4. centrifuge
5. For a 100 µL working solution, pipette 80 µL of molecular grade water into the newly labeled microcentrifuge tube and then add 10 µL of the stock solution of each primer.
6. Once the concentrated stock is added, vortex the new working solution for at least 00:00:10 and store at -20 °C to use as needed.
