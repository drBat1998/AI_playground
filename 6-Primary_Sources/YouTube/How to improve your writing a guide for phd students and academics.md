# Notes
Stractue is a key
1. describe situation 
2. Describe problem or question 
3. How others have responded to that problem 
4. Explain a need to approach 
Structure gives ability for narrative development and easear ways to extend 

Problem -> solution -> limitation -> alternative solution 

How to do
1. Reduce the scale of the task (simplify).
2. Separate exploration from presentation (mindmap for exploration, structure for presentation).
3. Moves forward but sometimes backwards (mountain digging).
4. Don't pick a phone when you step back.
5. Perfectionism is a spectrum
