# Notes
Properties of light
electromagnetic spectrum
	wavelength (lambda)
	amplitude
	frequency (1/s)
	speed 
	phase
	polarization
index of refraction is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in a material is called the index of refraction(n)

Interfaces 
	incident wave
	reflected wave
	refracted wave

focusing
each surfase of the lens refracte the wave

aberrations
chromatic aberration 
	index different for different wavelength light.
spherical aberration
