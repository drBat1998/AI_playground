# Notes
Here the author provide an interesting idea to change the morning pages into the playground of your thinking, choose the problem and write about it for 20 minutes. Then It would be interesting to detect key mistakes both in you reasoning and in you grammar/spelling fields. 

In additon, you must write to get clear for as larger groop of people as you could. 

And overall it would be interesting way to mediatate.
