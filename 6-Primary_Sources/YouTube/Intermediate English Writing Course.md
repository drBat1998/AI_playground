Movie review:
Yesterday, I watched Dracula 2025, another way to see old story about vampires and lovers, and it was disgusting. I would be more disappointed if I have bought this movie and do not watch it for free. First, I was and probably would be a fan of Bram Stoker's Dracula 1992, and for me it is a masterpiece with dark, grim music, amazing cast, and a small portion of love. In contrary, the new movie show only stupid love story of childish graph, with addition of stolen perfume line from Parfumer. Second, I didn't recall any horror felling from the film, not in slightest. Even more, the power of the vampire are redundant and only display in a few moment, when in the old movie the dark might of Dracula feels as a force of nature, unconditional and unbearable.


#### Building vocabulary
