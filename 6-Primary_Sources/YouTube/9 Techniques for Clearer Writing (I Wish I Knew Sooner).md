Title: 9 Techniques for Clearer Writing (I Wish I Knew Sooner)


# Notes
The sentence tells the story, so you should craft every single sentence. 
1. Central characters in the subject position.
2. Important actions
3. Use the zombie nouns - nouns from verbs and adjectives that drain life from your sentence.  How can we use it: 
	1. Use in the subject position to create flow. Watson discovered the structure of DNA. Their discovery has led to...
	2. Replace awkward noun clauses like the fact that or the idea that. His solution to the puzzle surprised me. 
	3. Turn clauses into objects. I approved his proposal.
Flow or paragraph-level techniques
4. Create cohesion by organizing information across sentences from OLD-> NEW.
5. Read your paragraph in three steps. 
	1. Underline each sentence before you underline the verb. 
	2. Read them and try to figure out if they are related, and do your readers see them as related as well.  
	3. Rewrite with consistent topics at the beginning of related sentences. 
6. Clearing the Runway. Start with easy and finish with more complex ideas, in the stress position. 
Idea level
7. If readers do not anchor by problem, they do not give a fuck about your idea. 
	Status quo (opposite of your idea) -> concession(their idea is not a completely piece of shit) -> Destabilizing their idea -> Const/benefit -> Solution.
8. Global Coherence (Curse of knowledge)
	1. Big picture
	2. Details.
	Help readers see the big picture:
	- Clean section boundaries
	- Short introductory segments
	-  Point sentence at the end of the introduction.
	- Repeated key concepts. 
9. Writing in Fractals
	1. Index 
	2. Discussion
