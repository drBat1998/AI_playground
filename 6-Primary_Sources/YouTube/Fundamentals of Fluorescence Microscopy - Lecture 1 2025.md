# Notes
Absorbtion
Excitation 
Emmision

Ground state - low energy. When the fluorophore absorbs the energy of the light, it undergoes a higher energy state called the excited state. Next, after a short period of time, called the excited lifetime, the energy drops and light is generated in the emitted light form.

Photobleaching is a chemical change in the fluorophore that unable the fluorophore cycle from emerging. 

Stroke shift is the difference between the excitation and emission maximum.

!stability is a t1/2 for photobleaching

Objective information
- Aberration correction
- Magnification
- Coverslip thickness
	- 0.17 = 170 um = 1.5 coverslip
	- 150 um  = 1 coverslip
	- 220 um = 2 coverslip

Lateral resolution does not relate to magnification, but to wavelength and numerical aperture.

Axial resolution is approximately 2-3x worse than lateral resolution. 
High numerical aperture -> high resolution
NA and magnification are factors for brightness

Working distance

Confocal pinhole, the smaller the better.

Confocal detectors
- gain amplification increases noise
- averaging = average of multiple acquisitions.
- offset

Pixelated images
- pixel size becomes crucial
- pixel size should be 3x smaller than the resolution required
