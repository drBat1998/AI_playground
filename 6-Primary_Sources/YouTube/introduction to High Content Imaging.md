# Notes
Automated imaging
- autfocusing
- automated multi-well imaging
- Identical field selection
Automated quantification
- Analysis pipeline

HCI examples 
1. Cell viability assay (Hoechst/Draq7)
2. Morphology assay
	1. Subcellular localization
	2. Neurite outgrowth
	3. Spot counting
3. Cell migration
4. Tracking

Image acquisition guideline

Plate selection
- glass 
- optical grade polystyrene
- thin (<200 μm)
- low bottom 
- without ribs

Autofocus may fail if:
- Bottom thickness varies a lot
- The plate bottom is not planar
- imaging near the well boundary
- The buffer is low

Humidity control on Zeiss CD7?
[[Zeiss questions]]
[[high content imaging]]

Seeding density
- high enough to have statistically meaningful results
- Low enough to segment the cell area properly
- 70-85 % for most applications
- 40-60 % application if the signal on the plasma membrane is important.
