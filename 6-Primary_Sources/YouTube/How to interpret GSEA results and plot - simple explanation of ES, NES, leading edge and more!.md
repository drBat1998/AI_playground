# Notes
Four key values would be given to you by GSEA
1. Enrichment score
2. Normalised enrichment score
3. False discovery rate
4. Nominal p-value

Enrichment score(ES) is the max deviation from 0, the biger ES the better. 
Gene sets with a distinct peak at the beginning or end of the ranked list are the most intersting. 

Positive ES - overexpression
Negative ES - downregulated

The ==leading edge== subset of a gene set is the subset of members that contribute most to the ES. 

Corelation with phenotype

Normalised enrichment score (NES) to compare the results across gene set. 

P-adj <0.05

q-value ore false discovery rate are corrected for multiple testing. FDR <0.25
