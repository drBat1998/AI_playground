# Notes
Wet and dry culture come from the book that describe culture approaches to drinking. In dry culture alcohol consume in special occasion and time usually in large quantities, on the contrary wet culture, like France or Italy, consume small portion every day.

This concept has been suggested to apply for reading practice by Robin Waldun. As, for me I try to reading something, nonfiction books, every day and make a dissent habit from these.
