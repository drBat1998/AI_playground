# Notes
Types of nucleotide:
1. ribonucleotide
2. deoxyribonucleotide
3. dideoxyribonucleotide - can not be read by polymerase.

The first sequence has a long sequence problem, 600 nucleotides. 

If you have a sequence of 45 nucleotide bases of a human gene, and try to find the mouse homolog. How do you determine if the gene you find is a homologue or just a similar one?
