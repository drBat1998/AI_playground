# Notes
Instance - example, subject
Feature - a measurable piece of data describing some aspect of instance.  a.k.a variable, atribute, independent variable.
Outcome - an event or metric that can be observed or measured. a.k.a. endpoing, dependent variable, class, label. 
Model -  a representation of reality. 
Algroithm - a set of instruction
[[machine learning]]
ML is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computure science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to "learn" with data, without being explicitly programmed.

Statistics vs. ML
Statistic making inference and focus on few features
ML focused on making predictions and play with many features.

MK 
- supervised learning - labeled data
	- classification
	- regression
- unsupervised learning - unlabeled data
	- clustering
	- dimensionality reduction
- semi-supervised learning - partially laveled data
- reinforcement learning - multi-step problems

Model parameter - not specified by particitioner and can be estimated from the data
Hyperparameters - value cannot be estimated, specified by practitioner
