# Notes
Prevent the reader from getting stuck. Flow of ideas, [[somentic flow]]. 

[[Cohesion]]: Context matters, and your reader probably does not have it. So, it is your job to provide essential background for the reader. Old information before new states. 

[[Coherence]]: one idea in one paragraph. One topic of the article, paragraphs should consist of one idea that promotes the grand idea mentioned in the thesis statement. 

[[Organization]]: The Structure has to make sense.
