# Notes
Basic concepts
AI is extreamly broad field of creating intelligent machines that can perform task that typiclaly require human intelligence.

ML - a subset of AI where algoritms learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. In two steps, feature extraction and classification.

DL - is a subset of ML using neural netwrorks with multiple layers, capable of learning complex patterns. 

The AI models have hyperparameters and parameters.
- the hyperparameters is used to adjust by hand (batch size, kernell, number of hidden layers)
- parameters is the nodes created by DL itself

Two family of ML/DL
- Supervised learning - data with label 
- Unsupervised learning - data without label

What AI/ML can automate or improve in bioimage analysis:
- segmentation
- classification
- noise reduction 
- feature extraction and quantification

Pixel classification
Object classification

Example of pixel classification
1. image preprocessing
2. feature extraction
3. training a classifier on labeled data
4. applying the clssifier to new images
Example of object classification
5. object detection 
6. feature extraction(size, int, texture)
7. training
8. classification

ML 
- complex patterns and variation handle
- train for specific reason

DL 
- more robust
- complex features that are hard to define

Reproducibility issues
1. Lack of records
2. Changes in data
3. Hyperparameter inconsistency
4. Randomness
5. Experimentation
6. Changes in ML frameworks
7. GPU floating-point discrepency
8. Nondetermine.
