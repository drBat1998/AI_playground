Title: How Modern Schools Make Terrible Writers (Deliberately)
Author: [[Writer Science]]
Tags: #writing #youtube 


# Notes
Two-step writing for sharing values:
1. First draft in order to select valuable insights and thoughts
2. Second draft to communicate the valuable insights to a reader. 

This leads to crafting a draft for the reader. 

School writing to expert writing
1. Lead with problems, not background information.
2. Locate your problems within your specific reading communities. 
3. Your idea is only valuable if readers perceive the problem it solves.
4. Focus on function. 
5. Changing how reading is thought.
