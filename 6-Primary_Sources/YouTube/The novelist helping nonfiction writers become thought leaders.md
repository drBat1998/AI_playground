# Notes
> The reader always decides what is good writing.
- I disagree, our mind day by day comes to a more primitive state, and really good writing may be too difficult for someone in the future. 

> For readers to read, the information must start from the problem, why the ideas are valuable to the reader
- The introduction should start with why the problem is so interesting.

Language, including word choice and sentence structure, gives a value to ideas. So, you can choose words to elevate one and diminish the other.  

> Subject must be consistent
 You must be aware of what you put down in the subject position and what in the object.

> Concrete language, abstraction should be based on something that the reader could imagine. 

Decide on a theme and a few key points that the reader should remember. 

A paragraph is a single message.
