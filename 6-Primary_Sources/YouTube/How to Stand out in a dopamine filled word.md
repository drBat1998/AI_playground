# Notes
Minimalist esthetic dominate our culture. This come from American style of writing. Maximalism what is it, can I somehow use it? 

Tree questions: Is it true, is it fair, Is it persuasive. 

Writing has an agenda, so we can't trust anyone in this dark time. Moreover, even I could be a producer of propaganda. 

Hour of reading of difficult book every morning. 

Mix of culture, people and ideas give birth to a new and potentially interesting stuff. 

Domain expertise is a foundation for writing. 

Consumtion is a fuel to writing, read and write.

Don't chaise dopamine culture.
