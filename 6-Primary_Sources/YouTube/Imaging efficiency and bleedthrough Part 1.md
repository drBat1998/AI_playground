# Notes
Bleedthrough = cross talk = cross over
Bleedthrough is when several fluorophores are recorded in a single image. 
Bleedthrough comes from poor experimental design.

Best strategy to avoid bleedthrough:
1. Design your sample to match the microscope specifications.
2. Design before you buy your fluorophores.

The excitation filter (Band pass filters)
470/40 means that center of the band is 470 and total band width is 40.

Multi band pass transmited.
