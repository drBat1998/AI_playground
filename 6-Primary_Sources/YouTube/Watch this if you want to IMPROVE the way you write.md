Title: Watch this if you want to IMPROVE the way you write
Author: [[Writer Science]]
Tags: #youtube #writing 


# Notes
To be crystal clear, you must repeat key information without sounding repetitive. 
The start of the sentence determines what the sentence is about. 
To improve coherence: all starts of sentences should be in some way categorized (Romanow, Peter the Great, and so on), and what finish one sentence should begin second. For this purpose, [[passive voice]] and [[noun phrases]] should be used. 

How to improve [[coherence]] inside the passage. 
1. Underline everything before the verb.
2. Look upon the underlined words; do they represent the same entity, or do they relate? 
3. Do they represent the character that the passage is about? If not, rewrite them.
