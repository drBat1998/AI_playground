## Introduction to Cloud computing infrastructure 

Cloud computing - the practice of using on-demand computing resources as services hosted over the internet.

Hardware 
Storage 
Network
Virtualization

## Cloud computing service models
IaaS - on-demand access to its infrastructure, high level of control
PaaS - hardware and software to build applications
SaaS - complete software ready to use, least level of control


## Benefits of computing service models
1. Accessibility
2. Scalability
3. Cost savings
4. Security
5. Efficiency


## Tradition vs Cloud computing
Advantages of traditional computing
1. Full control
2. Security
3. Compliance - company must follow some rules
4. no reliance on the internet
Disadvantages of traditional computing
1. Access is limited
2. difficult to scale
3. expensive
4. inefficient

## Cloud data warehouse
fully managed by the cloud provider
saves time and money
uptime management

Advantages of a Cloud Data Warehouse
- ability to scale
- integration of separated data
- real-time analytics
- AI ML capability
- custom reporting and analysis


## Introduction to bigQuery
A data warehouse on Google Cloud 

# Data analytics in the cloud
Steps for effective migration 
1. Chose environment 
2. How much data move
3. Downtime 
4. Migration strategy 
Migration strategy 
1. Rehosting or lift and shift - moving everything to cloud 
2. Replatforming - small change with local
3. Repurchasing 
4. Refactoring- del old 
5. Retiring

Migration path phases 
	Assess
	Plan
	Deploy 
	Optimize

## explore clou deployment models
Public - del computing storage .. through internet
Private - all resources to single user and organization 
Hybrid - hybrid 

## clouds role in advancing data analytics
Data integration - the process of combining data from different sources into single usable data source
ETL  - extract, transform, and load
ELT - extract, load, and transform 

Data ingestion - the process of obtaining, importing, and processing data for later use or storage.
Stream ingestion- real time processing of data
Batch ingestion- processing data in large chunks with define time interval 

Data types in cloud
- file data
- Object data
- Block data

## Cost consideration

Advanced provisioning 
Dynamic provisioning 
Self-provisioning
