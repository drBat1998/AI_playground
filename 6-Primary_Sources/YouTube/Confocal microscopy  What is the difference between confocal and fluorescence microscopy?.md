# Notes
A confocal microscope is sharper and has less background due to the use of a laser.

Only the light of interest (the light in the focus) could pass through the pinhole of the confocal microscope.  

Optical sectioning and Z stacking

Due to detecting a point in time, a confocal microscope could generate pictures with different z that my computer could reconstruct into a 3d image.

Adjusting gain and offset

Gain - signal power: the higher the gain settings, the brighter images get. 
Increasing of gain leads to an increase in background signal.

offset - the black value, by increasing the offset, the darkest areas of the image get brighter, and by decreasing the offset, the dark areas of the image get darker.
