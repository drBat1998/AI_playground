# Notes
Live cell imaging
1. Choose the right microscope
2. Selecting the correct fluorophore
3. Reduce phototoxicity
	1. Long wavelengths are best.
	2. Low excitation levels.
4. Image through coverslip 

Sample fixation
- glutaraldehyde - good morphology, poor stainings
- Paraformaldehyde - poor morphology, good stainings

High content imaging [[High-content image-based analysis]]
- automated
- unbiased imaging
- high throughput
- optimisation required 
- huge data generation

Widefield
- widefield deconvolution, clear samples in the case of cell culture

Data management 
- raw file ex. cvi , containing metadata
- export in tiff
