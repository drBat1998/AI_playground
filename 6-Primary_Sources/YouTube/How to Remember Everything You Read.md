# Notes
Consumption stage
Digestion stage

1.  Learning everything should not be a goal during reading
2.  Information is not the same
	P - procedure - how to do something - apply
	A - analogous - information about something you already know- critique
	C - conceptual - what is it (facts, theory, relationships between concepts)- mapping
	E - evidence - store and rehearse (how to apply the information)
	R - references - store and rehearse
3.  Consumption and digestion should be close in time, if not you should reduce consumption
