Tags: #youtube #writing 


# Notes
1. Passive is not always bad
	1. You want the sentence to focus on the object
	2. The subject that makes the action doesn't even matter. 
	3. The actor is unknown.
	4. To put the specific words in the stress position.
	5. Sounds better
2. Writing tools, not rules
3. Develop your style. 


You have to make a choice with the help of AI, but do not give all ruling privilege to AI.
