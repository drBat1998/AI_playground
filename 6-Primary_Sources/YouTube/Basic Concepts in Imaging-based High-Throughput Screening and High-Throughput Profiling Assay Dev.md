# Notes
Steps in HCS assay development 
1. Problem formulation - What biology am I interested in? - I am interesting in cell death
2. Assay concept - How will I measure the biology of interest? - cell membrane permebility, nuclei segmentation, cell morphology changes. 
3. Cell model - What cell model should I use? - rat hippocampal neurons or SH-N-SK
4. Plate types - What plat format should I use? - 20 or 96 well
5. Reagents and probes - How I visualize the biology of interest? - AO-green, AO-red, DRAQ7
6. Dynamic range - What range of response values should I expect?  - I don't know.
7. Exposure condition - In 4, 8 and 12 hours after OGD for 2-3 hours. How often should I take the pictures I don't know.
8. Controls/Assay performence - Negative control is clear control group, Positive control is H202 exposeure.

Cell model optimization
1. Media
2. Plate coationg
3. Seeding density
4. Passaging
5. Maintenance in cluture

Seeding density -> Overly confluent culutres
- Inaccurate segmetation
- Obscure the biology of interest

Multiplexing of fluorescent probes
- minimize cross-talk across fluorecent channels
- targets with higher signal shoul be imaged in lower wavelengths than targets with lower signal.
- Routinely evaluate cross-talk between channels using single-plex labeling and evaluation of  "off-channel" images.

Assay controls for HCS
	Untreated 
	Vehicle 
	Positive
	Negative
	No Label
