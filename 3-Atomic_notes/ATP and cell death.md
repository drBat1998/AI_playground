Title: ATP and cell death
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
ATP depletion followed by restoring ATP level apoptosis is dominent cell death. Necrosis appear during ATP depletion grater than 97% or long last depletion, 5 h in case of Hela [^1] and Jurkat cells[^3] Also, Apoptosis is extremely hungry for energy, it is still more preferable cell death.[^2]

Also, in case of ischemic condition, it is seams to be not a case CASP8 during MCAO in rats shows activities after 6h. [^5]

Other factors such metabolic disorder could influence the apoptosis or necrosis outcome. In fatty hepatocytes, necrosis prevails on apoptosis during ischemia.[^4]
