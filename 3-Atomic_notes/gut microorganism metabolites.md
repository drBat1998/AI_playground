Title: gut microorganism metabolites
tags: #atomic_note #gut_brain


# Notes
The gut microbiome has been shown to have a significant role in the well-being of any human being. The influence can be broadly categorized into four more or less distinct pathways: neuronal, endocrine, immune, and metabolic.  

Here, Liu et al try to classify of main components of the gut metabolome by dividing it into: 
1. Short-chain fatty acids, such as acetate, propionate, butyrate, hexanoate, isovalerate, isobutyrate, 2-methylpropionate, directly act on GPR receptors and HDAC 1/3.
2. Bile acid derivatives, such as cholate, hyocholate, deoxycholate, taurohyocholate, ursodeoxycholate, that directly act on  FXR, VDR, PXR/SXR, CAR, TGR5, S1PR2, FPR, mAChR receptors. 
3. Tryptophan and indole derivatives, such as indole-3-lactic acid, indole acetic acid, indole-3-acetamide, indole pyruvic acid, indoxyl sulfuric acid, indole, and serotonin, targeting AhR and PXR receptors. 
4. Choline metabolites, such as TMA, methylamine, dimethylglycine, and dimethylamine, by an unknown mechanism activate NF-кB, protein kinase C, and NLRP3 inflammasome.
5. Vitamins, such as B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, B12, and K, by and vitamin receptors. 
6. Neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, catecholamines, 5-HT, and GABA, act through their receptors.
