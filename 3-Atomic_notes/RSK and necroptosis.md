Title: RSK and necroptosis
tags: #atomic_note #cell_death 


# Notes
It has been unclear how the caspase 8 blockade of necroptosis is eliminated naturally. One of the first proposed mechanisms, suggested by Yang and colleagues[^2], involves RSK-mediated phosphorylation of caspase-8 that leads to its inactivation. The 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family of proteins is a group of highly conserved Ser/Thr kinases that regulate diverse cellular processes, such as cell growth, cell motility, cell survival, and cell proliferation. In case of caspase 8 disactivation, RSKs phosphorylate procaspase 8 at Thr265.

To prove that Thr265 phosphorylation is crucial for necroptosis,  the authors presented a series of evidence. First, they labelled phosphorylated procaspase-8 at Thr265 with antibodies and showed that phosphorylation occurs following TNFα administration and does not occur in RIP3-, MLKL-, or RIP1- knockout cells. Second, they showed that phosphorylated procaspase-8 is part of the necrosome by immunoprecipitation and noted that it lacks enzymatic activity, as measured with a commercially available caspase-8 activity kit. Third, Yang et al. introduced a mutation at the Thr265 site in embryos and found that these embryos were viable and showed no sign of necroptotic death. Overall, RSK1 deletion phenocopies RIP3 or MLKL knockout in L929 cells. 

Interestingly, RSK1 association with the necrosome occurs only after MLKL is incorporated into the complex. Moreover, recruitment of RSK1 does not require caspase-8, FADD, or RIP1, since RSK1 can be recruited to the RIP3–MLKL complex induced by artificial RIP3 dimerization.

These data were confirmed by two other research groups. He et al. also showed that phosphorylated caspase-8 in TNF-treated mice suppresses caspase-8 activity in the cecum, which promotes necroptosis.[^3]
Wang et al. demonstrated that RSK3 mediates necroptosis by regulating phosphorylation of RIP3 in rat retinal ganglion cells during OGD injury, and that interference with RSK3 activity, both genetic and pharmacological, reduces necroptosis in RGC-5 cells after ischemic injury[^1].



In addition, Yang and colleagues propose that RSK Is activated by an ERK-independent, but PDK1-dependent mechanism in TNF-Treated Cells [^2]

The mechanisms by which caspase-8 suppression is naturally achieved to permit necroptosis have remained elusive. One of the first proposed mechanisms, described by Yang et al.[^2], involves phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of caspase-8 by the ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family. RSKs are a group of highly conserved serine/threonine kinases known to regulate diverse cellular processes including growth, survival, and motility. Specifically, RSK phosphorylates procaspase-8 at threonine 265 (Thr265), thereby abolishing its proteolytic activity and enabling necroptosis.

To establish the role of Thr265 phosphorylation, Yang and colleagues provided a sequence of evidence. First, they used phospho-specific antibodies to detect Thr265-phosphorylated procaspase-8, which was present following TNFα treatment but absent in RIPK1-, RIPK3-, or MLKL-deficient cells. Second, immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the phosphorylated form of procaspase-8 is incorporated into the necrosome complex and lacks enzymatic activity, as confirmed using a caspase-8 activity assay. Third, embryos harboring a Thr265 mutation developed normally and did not exhibit necroptotic features, supporting the critical nature of this site in regulating caspase-8 activity. Notably, RSK1 deletion in L929 cells phenocopied the absence of RIPK3 or MLKL, further supporting its essential role in necroptosis execution.

Interestingly, RSK1 associates with the necrosome only after MLKL is incorporated, and its recruitment does not depend on caspase-8, FADD, or RIPK1. In fact, RSK1 can bind to the RIPK3–MLKL complex following artificial RIPK3 dimerization, indicating a downstream or parallel recruitment pathway.

These findings have been corroborated by other groups. He et al. reported that in TNF-treated mice, phosphorylated caspase-8 in the cecum is catalytically inactive, thereby facilitating necroptosis[^3]. In parallel, Wang et al. demonstrated that RSK3 promotes necroptosis through phosphorylation of RIPK3 in retinal ganglion cells subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of RSK3 significantly reduced necroptotic cell death in RGC-5 cells following ischemic insult[^1].
