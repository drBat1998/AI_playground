Acetate supplementation attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation

Acetate supplementation attenuates neuroglia activation in a rat model of neuroinflammation by a mechanism associated with an increase in brain acetyl-CoA, an alteration in histone acetylation, and reduction of interleukin (IL)-1β expression. We propose that reduced astroglial activation occurs by disrupting astrocyte-derived inflammatory signaling and cytokine release. Using primary astroglial cultures, we found that LPS (0-25 ng/ml, 4 h) increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and IL-1β in a concentration-dependent manner, which was reduced by treatment with sodium acetate (12 mM). LPS did not alter H3K9 acetylation or IL-6 levels, whereas acetate treatment increased H3K9 acetylation by 2-fold and decreased basal levels of IL-6 by 2-fold. Acetate treatment attenuated the LPS-induced increase in TNF-α mRNA, but did not reverse the mRNA levels of other pro-inflammatory cytokines. By contrast, LPS decreased TGF-β1 and IL-4 protein and TGF-β1 mRNA, all of which was reversed with acetate treatment. Further, we found that acetate treatment completely reversed LPS-induced phosphorylation of MAPK p38 and decreased basal levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2 (ERK1/2) by 2-fold. Acetate treatment also reversed LPS-elevated NF-κB p65, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta protein levels, and reduced basal levels of phosphorylated NF-κB p65 at serine 536. These results suggest that acetate treatment has a net anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-stimulated astrocytes that is largely associated with a disruption in MAPK and NF-κB signaling.
