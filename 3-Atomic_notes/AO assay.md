Title: AO assay
Tags: #atomic_note 


# Notes
AO absorbs blue light (∼458 nm) and emits green light (∼530 nm) with separate RNA and DNA. In high concentrations of RNA and DNA, or in acidic vesicles, AO is organized as stacks, which shifts the emission spectrum to red light (∼640 nm)[^3].

[[AO is more sensitive than the MTT assay]]
## Method
2.5 μM does not affect cell viability in the context of 4h screening in cancer cells; higher concentrations do not affect cell viability, but they affect cell morphology[^3]. 

Cells were incubated with 5 μM of Acridine orange for 30 minutes at 37C. Then cells were washed, and take image of them was taken for 120 minutes.[^1]

SH-SY5Y were incubated with 1 ug/ml acridine orange for 15 minutes at room temperature, washed with PBS.[^2]
## Interpritation
Healthy cells have red cytoplasmic staining pattern and mixed red/green nuclear staining.

The nuclear red peak is reduced during cell damage. Reduced red AO emission, therefore, also reflects a retracted cellular membrane.

AO red accumulates in acidic vesicles; however, the interpretation should be cautious.
