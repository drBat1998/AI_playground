 standard error of the mean (SEM), which is a measure of how much the sample mean (average) is expected to vary from the true population mean.

Explanation of the Formula

The formula you’re referring to is:


$\text{Standard Error (SE)} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$


where:
•	$\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the original population (how spread out the data is).
•	n is the sample size (the number of observations in the sample).

Why This Formula?

•	$\sigma$ tells us how much the individual data points vary.
•	$\sqrt{n}$ adjusts this variation based on how many data points you have.
•	As the sample size n increases, \sqrt{n} gets larger, making the SE smaller. This means that with larger samples, the average of those samples is likely closer to the true population average.

In Simple Terms
•	If you take many samples from a population and calculate the average of each sample, the SE tells you how much these sample averages are expected to jump around.
•	Larger samples make your average more reliable because they reduce the “jumpiness” or uncertainty, reflected in the smaller SE.
