Title: zombosomes
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
Zombosomes are a delivery system that contains organelles, vimentin core, and other proteins. The system is not passive and actively moves in a short range. 

This delivery system is specific to astrocytes, although something similar exists in cancer cells ( blebbisomes), and C. elegans neurons and mammalian cardiomyocytes (exophers). Despite significant similarities with exophers, zombosomes can actively migrate.

The zombosome may play an important role in the spreading of misfolded and pathological proteins, such as a-synuclein. Neurons exposed to a-synuclein contained zombosomes showed a significant p-α-syn level. So, the zombosomes can promote protein production in anatomically connected regions alongside tunneling nanotubes and extracellular vesicles. 

It is interesting to investigate whether tunneling nanotubes or zombosomes promote cell death by spreading key cell death proteins.

The problem of proteinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, grows day by day. The spread of the pathological proteins, including alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease, is a major question for recent investigation. Dakhel et al. discover a new delivery system for the pathological proteins. Zombosomes are fragments of a cell that can move within a relatively small area and spread malfunctioning proteins and organelles. Extremely interesting: what else can the system transfer, maybe even death itself?
