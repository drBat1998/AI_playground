Title: PANoptosis and ischemia
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
Previous research has shown that different cell death pathways occur during ischemia, ranging from well-studied apoptosis to more uncommon pathways such as parthanatosis or necroptosis. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence indicates interactions among some of these pathways. In 2019, Kanneganti et al., in a condition unrelated to ischemia, suggested that specific triggers might induce multiple types of cell death (pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis) simultaneously and termed this "PANoptosis". Researchers reported that the loss of a single component is insufficient to prevent cell death. 

Although PANoptosis was discovered and studied in the context of immune responses to PAMPs, few publications explore deep interactions between cell death pathways during oxygen-glucose deprivation, without explicitly stating that it is PANoptosis. [^1] 

Gutierrez et al. verified that MLKL interacts with the NLRP3 inflammasome, which processes and activates IL-1β during necroptosis, suggesting that necroptosis is connected to other forms of cell death like pyroptosis. [^24] 

Interestingly, co-culturing OGD-damaged neurons with mesenchymal stem cells showed that the stem cells could inhibit parthanatos, necroptosis, and apoptosis by alleviating apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF).[^14] 

Additionally, although some authors state they have studied PANoptosis in certain models, distinguishing true PANoptosis (three modes in one cell) from simultaneous distinct death types in different cells is methodologically difficult. Tools to definitively prove PANoptosis, particularly in vivo or in ischemia models, are still being developed.[^2]
