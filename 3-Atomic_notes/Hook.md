# Notes
The hook is a statement that grabs the audience's attention, it could be a quotation or question, but arguably the best way to start an essay is irony. Even if the reader doesn't get it, he would read the essay to to argue with your opinion. The hook should force the reader to think about the topic and inspire them to read more. A story, metaphor, unexpected statement, or shocking statistics are quite a nice hook too.
