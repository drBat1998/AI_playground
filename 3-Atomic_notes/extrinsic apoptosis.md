# Notes
Extrinsic apoptosis is a form of regulated cell death triggered by signals outside the cell. Two receptor families set the process in motion. Death receptors—such as Fas and members of the TNF-receptor family—activate when a ligand binds to them. Dependence receptors flip the switch in the opposite way: they become pro-death when their ligand falls below a critical level.

Once a death receptor is engaged, multiple proteins assemble in a so-called death-inducing signaling complex. Astonishing in the complexity mechanism that determines would the cell lives or dies. In simple terms, if multiple molecules maintain caspase 8 inactive, the cell would be live or even contribute to inflammation, signaling other cells that something is going in the wrong direction. On the other hand, if CASP 8 were to be activated, the mighty blow from the hammer called executor caspase 3 would annihilate the cell. 

Caspase 8 (CASP8) is the central molecule in the regulation of extrinsic apoptosis. Multiple studies show that cFLIP seems to inhibit CASP8 activity. What is particularly interesting is that the cFLIP gene takes direct orders from NFκB, a prosurvival and proinflammatory transcription factor. So, if NFκB has been activated and inflammation already persists, the cells should die less. But this is rarely the case; other, more dangerous cell death types occur. Researchers have speculated that necroptosis (programmed cell death with the morphological and biochemical characteristics of necrosis) is directly inhibited by CASP8, so if something represses the caspase, the cell would die a more severe death than it should.
