## 17. Likelihood based on conditions 1

provided/providing that; so/as long as.
	more emphasis than "if".

## 25 Nominalisation in writing English
Nominalisation is when we choose to give the key information as a noun phrase rather than as a verb.
Usually, we use subj+verb:
	I reacted badly. 
	Then really quickly my foot began to get red and swell up
In formal writing, we often use a noun instead of the verb to sound more impersonal.
	Following a bee sting, the normal reaction is redness, irritation, and itching.
We can also change some adjectives to nouns. 
	The cathedral is tall and can be seen from all over the town. 
	The cathedral's height makes it visible all over town.

Action or events may be expressed as nouns or noun phrases: swell up => swelling.
Events are expressed impersonally: I react badly => the normal reaction is bad.
Nouns used as subject 
verbs are often non-action or event verbs: be or have
sentences have a lot of vocabulary words.
