Title: Deliberate Practice in Writing
tags: #atomic_note #writing 


# Notes
I have to practice writing in moderate-sized pieces, so I chose 280 characters for X and/or 300 words for my mini essay - [[My essay style]]. 

I want to practice writing in English, so I need to practice grammar, vocabulary, and spelling.
1. Grammar
2. Vocabulary
3. Spelling

I would add what I want to practice in writing below:
1. Central character into the subject position. [^1]
