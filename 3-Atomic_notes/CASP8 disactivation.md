Title: CASP8 disactivation
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
Velier et al. showed that within the core infarct, active caspase-8 was found as early as 6 hr.

CHAT: 
So ischemia-induced caspase-8 inhibition must rely on **other mechanisms**, such as:
- oxidative/nitrosative modification of caspase-8 +
- calcium-activated calpain degradation of caspase-8 - 
- acidic pH reducing enzymatic kinetics - , but induce necroptosis by other way
- stress granule dissolution and ZBP1-dependent necrosome formation
