Title: accidental cell death
tags: #atomic_note #cell_death 


# Notes
Accidental cell death (ACD) is cathastrophic event induced by extreme chemical, physical or/and mechanical stress. This cell death type more comonly named necrosis does not base on regulated mechanism that can be influence geneticaly or pharmacologicaly. The ACD may be change base sligtly on genetic mechanism due to different level of stress that different cell type could bere. Some cells in our body more resilent than other, moreover necrosis have plenty morphological specification base on tissue and couse. So, I guess it is partialy untrue that ACD is accidental completly.
