Title: AβO damage mechanisms
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
AβO has different damage properties:
1. AβOs can insert directly into lipid bilayers, though they alter their function.
2. AβOs also bind to membrane-specific receptors, triggering downstream signaling pathways.
3. AβOs enter the cell through endocytosis by triggering several receptors. 
4.  AβOs trigger mitochondrial damage by morphological disruption, electron transport chain processes, and induction of oxidative stress.

Mitochondria, membrane organelles, are susceptible to toxicity, which leads to disrupting their functions, inhibition of the electron chain, accumulation of ROS, and mtDNA. AβO-induced mitochondrial damage appears to be restricted to neurons and not to occur in astrocytes or microglia.
