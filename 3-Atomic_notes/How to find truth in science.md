Title: How to find truth in science

# Notes
Science is a craft in which you constantly have to shift your perspective on some problems and change your beliefs. A few days ago, I wrote a post about ZBP1-induced necroptosis in the liver under ischemic conditions. The data and work of Lin and colleagues feel quite persuasive; many good methods and a logical structure convince me of the existence of necroptosis in hepatocytes. However, Liu et al. argue that the paper is not perfect. They cited a few papers and stated that RIPK3, a crucial necroptosis marker, is not expressed in hepatocytes in sufficient quantities for necroptosis induction.

Unfortunately, my level of expertise does not give me a chance to identify the truth. But I'm definitely adding a bunch of tools to my scientific reading approach. First, two or more sources stating the same thing gives the notion credibility. Second, I am going to deliberately try to find the opposite point of view to the notion. Only after this procedure would I more or less sleep properly.
