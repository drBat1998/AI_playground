Title: pyroptosis
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
Pyroptosis is characterized by cellular swelling and rupture. Multiple stimuli activates NLRP3, this leeds to inflammasome assembly and CASP1 activation, following GSDMD cleaveage by CASP1. GSDMD forms pores that trigger cell execution in pyroptosis. In addtion to GSDMD, CASP1 promotes IL1b and IL18 cleavage and activation[^1]
