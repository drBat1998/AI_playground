# Notes

The gut microbiome affects the central nervous system via neural, endocrine, immunem, and metabolic mechanisms.

The neural, the most well-established route, consists vagus nerve and the enteric nervous system, a neuronal network of the gut itself. In addition, the gut is also considered an "endocrine organ"; numerous enteroendocrine cells in response to various stimuli secrete hormones. Secretion of lucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) is directly influenced by microbial metabolites. Microbial metabolites themselves, including but possibly not limited to SCFAs, tryptophan-derived metabolites, secondary bile acids, TMAO, and polyphenol derivatives, are also an important part of bidirectional interactions. Some of them can cross the blood-brain barrier and directly influence the brain. But the most strange pathway in my point of view is immunem, accumulative data suggest that microbiome regulates the host immune system and as a consequence the immune response. [^1]
