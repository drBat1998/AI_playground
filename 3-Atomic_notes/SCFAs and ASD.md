Title: SCFAs and ASD
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is rapidly spreading today, it is safely suggested that we have a pandemic of this disorder. Many causes could lead to autism, from heredity to environmental factors, unexpectedly, even microorganisms located inside the mother's gut could have an influence.  It had been more than a decade since scientists revealed to the world that microorganisms inside us have an enormous impact on our brain. So, many asked a question, how these tiny organisms could be related to ASD. Extremely interesting publication made by Adbelli and all showed that the two key chemicals made by the microbiome promote the proliferation of key brain cells. 

Propionic acid shifts the differentiation of human neuronal stem cells toward glial components. 
The propionic acid produced by our gut microorganisms enters the blood and moves towards the brain. It can cross the barrier that separates our brain from the blood and affects it. In contrast to other acids produced by the microbiome, the propionic acid promotes differentiation of neuronal stem cells to glial branch. In small concentrations it leads to beneficial effects due to the significance of glial cells inside our brain, from regulation of metabolism to the neurotransmitters concentration. While the concentration of propionic acids is growing, it leads to an excessive amount of glial cells that affect the connection inside the brain, especially during the development stage, and increase the activity of glial cells that may lead to neuroinflammation. 

Propionic acid regulates PTEN and Akt
