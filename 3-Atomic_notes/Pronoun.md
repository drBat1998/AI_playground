# Notes
Pronouns are substitutes for nouns.
Antecedent is mentioned previous noun before pronouns can be used. 

#### Personal pronouns:
I/me
she/her
he/him
they/them
it
we/us
you
_I_, _he_, _she_, _they_, and _we_. - subj
_me_, _him_, _her_, _them_, and _us_ - obj
#### Relative pronouns
They connect relative clauses to independent clauses or introduce additional information about something. 
that -things
what
which -things
who - person, is the subject of a sentence or clause
whom - is for the object of a verb or preposition

The woman who called earlier didn't leave a message. 
My car, which is nearly twenty years old, still runs well.

Who mailed this package?
To whom was this package sent?
#### Demonstrative pronouns
- The pronouns point directly to things
- The distance can be physical or metaphorical.
this - nearby, singular item
these - nearby, multiple things. 
That - far away, singular item. 
Those - far away, multiple items.
#### Indefinite pronouns
- things or a person that doesn't need to be specifically identified
- When an indefinite pronoun functions as the subject of a sentence, it usually takes singular verbs. 
one
other
none
some
anybody
everybody
no one

#### Reflexive pronouns
- personal pronouns that end in -self or -selves. 
- You can use a reflexive pronoun as the object of a verb or preposition to refer back to the subject of the sentence or clause
myself
yourself
himself
herself
itself
oneself
ourselves
yourselves
themselves

She checked herself. Lola made herself a smoothie. 
Using _myself_ when you mean _me_ is a common mistake writers and speakers make. Reflexive pronouns are correct only when the subject and object of a verb are the same. If you’re using a pronoun as an object but it refers to an antecedent that is _not_ the subject of the sentence or clause, you use an object pronoun instead:
Shit _He_ _asked_ **_myself_** _to go for a bike ride._
Good: _He_ _asked_ **_me_** _to go for a bike ride._
Good: _I_ _had promised_ **_myself_** _I would accept more invitations._

Intensive pronouns
- same as reflexive pronouns
- If you can remove a pronoun from a sentence and it loses emphasis but its meaning stays the same, it’s most likely an intensive pronoun.
- Express pride, shock, disbelief, credulousness, or another strong emotion. 
 I built this house _myself_
They hiked the entire Appalachian Trail _themselves_? 

Possessive pronouns

mine
yours
ours
his
hers

its
