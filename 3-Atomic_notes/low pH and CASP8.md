Title: low pH and CASP8
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
Ischemic cells generate lactic acid and shift intracellular pH to more acidic through undergoing anaerobic metabolism. Low pH does not impare CASP8 activity in endothelial cells, and CASP8 function in RIPK1 cleavage still remain. Interestingly in this case necroptosis also occure, however the mechanism is not discribe sufficiently.  [^2] Acidosis, low pH, may promote necoptosis other way, through acid-sensing ion channel 1a
Long term explosion to acidic pH not only do not decrease CASP8 activity, but show significant potentiation of CAPS8 and CASP3 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.[^1]
