Title: Treatment of Stroke
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
Current guidelines recommend intravenous thrombolysis as a primary stroke treatment within 4 to 5 h after stroke onset. In cases of large vessel occlusion, the treatment window for endovascular thrombectomy has been extended to 24 hours from symptom onset, based on imaging evidence of salvageable brain tissue or collateral flow.
