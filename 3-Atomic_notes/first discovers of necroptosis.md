Title: First Discoveries of Necroptosis
Tags: #cell_death #atomic_note 


# Notes
Although the first evidence of caspase-independent cell death with morphological features of necrosis began to be elucidated by many researchers in 1988, the greatest breakthrough came in 2000 when Holler et al. discovered that receptor-interacting protein kinase plays a crucial regulatory role.[^2] In the context of ischemia and necroptosis, pioneers Degterev and colleagues showed that cell death is a crucial factor in an ischemic in vivo model. Moreover, they proposed the term for this caspase-independent cell death—necroptosis. They were also the first to provide a specific receptor-interacting protein kinase inhibitor, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1).[^1] Following this research, the groups of Xu and Bruno independently began studying necroptosis in an oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro model of cortical neurons.[^3][^4]
