Title: GSK3b
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) is a serine-threonine protein kinase that has been shown to have a significant role in neuroinflammation and gliosis. RIPK1 can influence GSK3β through the PI3K-Akt pathway activation. Interestingly, Liu et al. showed that inhibition of p-GSK3β by SB216763 reduces the activity of the RIPK1–RIPK3–MLKL pathway and decreases LDH release and the number of PI-positive cells. This suggests that GSK3β acts upstream of necroptosis or contributes to a feedback loop that sustains it.
