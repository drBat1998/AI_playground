Title: Triad3A

# Notes
Triad3A, also known as RNF216, is a RING-in between-RING (RBR) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Triad3A has been reported to regulate different key proteins during neuropathological conditions, including but not limited to Toll-like receptors, Tumor Necrosis factor-receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF3), and the autophagy regulator Beclin. Recent studies showed that Triad3A is also elevated during ischemic conditions. The ligase suppresses the capacity of TLRs (TLR4, 5, and 9) to stimulate NF-κB and degradation of the early necrosome to limit necroptosis. Intriguingly, Yuan et al. reveal by immunoprecipitation that Triad3A interacts with MLKL, so it is posible that Triad3A directly inhibits necroptosis by proteosome proteolysis.
