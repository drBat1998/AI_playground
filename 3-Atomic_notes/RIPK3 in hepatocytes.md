Title: RIPK3 in hepatocytes

> RIPK3 existence in hepatocytes shows some contradiction. The author of [[liuZBP1mediatedApoptosisInflammation2024]] states that RIPK3 is not expressed in hepatocytes sufficiently to induce necroptosis, which contradicts the paper I read before: [[linZBP1sensedHypoxicStress2025]]

RIPK3 expression in normal conditions in hepatocytes and adipocytes does not appear. However, deletion of CASP8 elucidated that necroptosis in some way occurs in the liver. Probably due to RIPK3 expression in other cell types.
In adipose tissue, immune cells may be a source of RIPK3 expression.

Hepatocytes, in contrast to other cells inside the liver, have poor expression of RIPK3. This reduced expression is consistent in both mouse and human hepatocytes. Interestingly, if human-derived pluripotent cells do not undergo sufficient differentiation, they express a significant level of RIPK3. This notion leads to two important conclusions. First, the level of RIPK3 inside hepatocytes is questionable, so the paper, which states a significant role of necroptosis in liver diseases, should be carefully examined. Second, necroptosis is cell type-dependent.

In this article, the expression of RIPK3 in the liver was only assessed by qPCR and not by blot. Moreover, the level detected in the liver is not in a specific cell type. Overall, the authors didn't detect any significant role of necroptosis in hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury.
