Title: nonapoptotic function of CASP3
tags: #atomic_note 


# Notes

The caspase-dependent cell death mechanism is extremely conserved in evolution, from C. elegans to humans. Recent research has kindly broken my brain and my faith in something stable in biology, thanks Bogdan. Caspase-3, the executor of the cell during apoptosis, the irreversible judge in my view, has physiological functions that do not cause cell death. Multiple papers suggest that it is involved in neural stem cell differentiation, in neurite extension, elimination of synaptic connections, local pruning, axonal length regulation, and so on. 

This certainly complicates neurological disease research. Louneva et al. found that in both control and AD cases, there is a selective enrichment of caspase-3 at synapses, particularly in the postsynaptic compartment. Moreover, AD patients exhibited significant increases in synaptic procaspase-3 and active caspase-3 expression levels compared with age-matched controls.

This challenges everything that I believe and elucidates a bunch of questions. How does caspase-3 choose which function it will perform: to execute or to promote cell development? How does it deliberately discriminate its actions during pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease?
