Title: ATP depletion inhibits CASP8 activation
tags: #atomic_note #cell_death 


# Notes
Caspase activation, as well as apoptosis itself, is an energy-consuming process. 

Ferrari et al. demonstrated that ATP reduction or inhibition of ATP production reduces CASP8 activity in context of receptor-independent pathway of apoptosis. 


Ischemic reperfusion damage unleashes the apoptosis cascade in normal hepatocytes; on the contrary, hepatocytes during steatosis have a lower level of key apoptotic players and have more prominent necrosis. 
Selzner and colleagues, who provide the data, indicate that one of the key causes may be a low adenosine triphosphate production in fatty hepatocytes.[^1]

Severe ATP depletion necrosis related morphology, moderate ATP depletion leads to apoptosis.[[@lieberthalGradedATPDepletion1998]]
