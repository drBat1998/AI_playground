Title: Akt mTOR and necroptosis
tags: #atomic_note #cell_death 


# Notes
The AKT/mTOR pathway is a well-studied intracellular signaling pathway involved in regulating cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism. Interestingly, even this "cliché" mechanism may sometimes elicit a “wow” reaction. Relatively new studies suggest that this signaling cascade plays some role during necroptosis (programmed necrosis); in some cases, the effect appears to be positive, as suggested by the data. AKT has a long history of well-documented anti-apoptotic function. Therefore, recent reports speculating that AKT promotes, rather than inhibits, programmed necrosis feel a little bit wild.

Min et al. indicated that traumatic brain injury induces phosphorylation of both Akt/mTOR and RIPK3/MLKL pathways (necroptosis cascade). Moreover, the implementation of RIPK3 inhibitor (GSK’872) reduces Akt/mTOR activity, suggesting that RIPK3 is an upstream Akt/mTOR regulator. [^3]

Supporting the notion that RIPK3 is upstream of AKT or mTOR, AKT/mTOR inhibition did not significantly affect necrosome formation. But, reduce the cell death rate both by genetic and pharmacological AKT/mTOR inhibition. Interestingly, the combination of AKT and mTOR inhibition leads to much more significant necroptosis reduction than either one alone. So, maybe that influences necroptosis via a different pathway. In addition, during induction of necroptosis by TNF/zVAD, the authors reported increased phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR, as well as phosphorylation of direct target substrates such as GSK-3β, FOXO1, and the S6 ribosomal protein.[^1]

The Min et al.[^3] and Liu et al.[^1] groups speculated that AKT/mTOR influences necroptosis in two distinct ways—through ROS generation and apoptosis inhibition. First, FOXO1 is required for antioxidant defenses, and its degradation is directly controlled by the AKT pathway. Thus, over-activation of AKT/mTOR may reduce the cell’s antioxidant mechanisms and elevate ROS, which is an essential component for maintaining the necroptosis rate.[^1] Second, AKT inhibits caspase-8 by activating FLIPs; it is well-known that caspase-8 activity directly inhibits necrosome formation and, as a result, necroptosis execution.





HDAC and the autophagy initiator could protect from TNF-induced necroptosis in some cases. But the protection effects are inconsistent even in the same cell line. Wang et al.'s data suggest that necroptosis decreases when Akt and mTOR are deactivated and autophagy is initiated.[^2]

Pharmacological inhibition of Akt and mTOR reduced necrotic cell death in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus.
