Title: ZBP1 and HDAC
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
Histone deacetylases are essential epigenetic regulators that remove the acetyl group, thereby modifying gene transcription. Broadly, the HDACs are divided into two groups, classical (classes I, II, and IV) and non-classical (class III). This division depends on the metal ion Zn, which is essential for classical HDACs and the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), of equal importance for non-classical HDACs. 

Wang and colleagues showed that HDAC3, a prominent member of class I, was previously observed in neuronal plasticity, memory formation, and inflammatory response. The researchers proposed that HDAC3 represses Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) expression in the context of an ischemic stroke model. 

Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), also known as DAI, is a protein that acts as a sensor for Z-nucleic acids (Z-DNA and Z-RNA) in the cell. It plays a crucial role in the innate immune response, particularly in antiviral defense and inflammatory cell death.

RGFP966, the selective inhibitor of HDAC3, significantly attenuates ischemic injury, improves mice behaviour after stroke, and, more importantly, downregulates ZBP1 receptor.
