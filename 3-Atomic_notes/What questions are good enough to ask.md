# Notes
In contrast to [[Transcription notes]], the good notes shall arise from good questions. 

The list of good questions:
- How did the chapter or the article change my understanding of the topic described in it?
- Are the ideas clearly connected?
- Are there gaps in the logic?
- Are you missing information?
- How does the text flow?
