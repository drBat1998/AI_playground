Title: Importance of using CASP3-7 detector
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
Live cell imaging using a CASP3/7-sensitive probe can separate secondary necrosis from primary and regulated forms of necrosis. This is especially important due to the lack of phagocytosis in the context of general in vitro models. Overal real-time kinetic studies may be further beneficial specialy in cancer treatment and neurotoxicity research.
