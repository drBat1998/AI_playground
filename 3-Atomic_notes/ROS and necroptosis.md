Title: ROS and necroptosis
tags: #atomic_note #cell_death 


# Notes
Reactive oxygen species correlate with necroptosis in different contexts, from cancer to ischemia. Several studies suggest that RIPK1 promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation via NOX1 and RAC1; RIPK3, on the other hand, elevates ROS through GLUD1. Moreover, Nec-1 could decrease ROS production.

Interestingly, ROS promotes RIPK1 autophosphorylation, as demonstrated by Zang et al. ROS targets cysteine S161, enhances and facilitates necrosome formation, and, as a consequence, further maintains necroptosis.

What's even more fascinating: butylated hydroxyanisole–mediated decrease of reactive oxygen species does not significantly affect necroptosis initiation.[^1][^2] So, these data suggest that ROS plays a significant role in necroptosis as part of the positive loop.


Zhao et al. speculated that H₂O₂ induces necroptosis in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. H₂O₂ promoted both apoptosis and necroptosis in this context. When they tried to treat the cells with necrostatin-1 (a RIPK1 inhibitor), cell viability increased dramatically, which did not add anything new to the understanding of necroptosis. But what was interesting transfection with RIPK1-siRNA did not replicate that protection; similar results were obtained only after RIPK3 inhibition. Zhao et al. stated that it was due to other functions of RIPK1, such as NF-κB induction.[^3]

Tong and colleagues[^4] determined to study what cell death occurs due to oxidative stress in retinal macula cells, the model of age-related macular degeneration. They found necroptosis and ferroptosis more important than pyroptosis or apoptosis during oxidative stress in the cells. Furthermore, the reagents of ROS induction determine which cell death pathway the cells undergo; the RSL3, for example, leads to ferroptosis, and 4-HNE or shikonin-treated cells eventually die by necroptosis. 
Even more, they postulate that RIPK1 and RIPK3, the components of the necroptosome, are also important for ferroptosis. Which raises the question, what are the key differences between necroptosis and ferroptosis?
The research suggests that:
1. MLKL is important only for necroptosis, evidenced by both MLKL inhibitor and genetic deletion.
2. Lipid oxidation is much more prominent in ferroptosis. 
These data provide an additional framework for further studying both cell death types.
