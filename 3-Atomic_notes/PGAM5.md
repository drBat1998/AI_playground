# Notes

PGAM5 is a ser/thr protein phosphatase that is crucial for multiple physiological functions of mitochondria, including mitochondrial fission to mitophagy. Phosphatase activity of PGAM5 is required for the activation of stress-responsive MAP kinase pathways. Moreover, numerous studies claim that PFAM5 regulates different cell death. In the case of apoptosis, PGAM5 has a dual role depending on damage severity. In the case of necroptosis, PGAM5 is a downstream molecule of RIPK3.
