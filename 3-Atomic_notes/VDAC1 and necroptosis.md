Title: VDAC1 and necroptosis

# Notes


VDAC1 is known to be localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. It performs several important functions in the cell, including the regulation of cell death. VDAC1 is a key player in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, participating in the release of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins into the cytosol (e.g. cytochrome c, AIF, and Smac/DIABLO).


PPID, VDAC1, and VDAC2 are mitochondrial regulators, and PPID is one of the key proteins for cell death58. Elevated PPID phosphorylation causes mitochondrial permeability to excessive pore openings, leading to the development of necroptosis59.[^1]


Upon activation, MLKL targets not only the plasma membrane but also other membrane-bound organelles, such as lysosomes, nuclei, and mitochondria. In order to understand the role of MLKL in mitochondria, Wan and colleagues performed a set of experiments. They showed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting (WB) that MLKL directly interacts with VDAC1. Moreover, genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting MLKL or VDAC1 leads to decreased levels of ROS and Ca²⁺, and overall necroptosis suppression. VDAC1 is known to upregulate mitochondrial permeability, which leads to the leakage of cytochrome c, mtDNA, intracellular Ca²⁺, and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the authors speculated that MLKL promotes VDAC1 oligomerization. In addition to necroptosis, this pathway may also lead to intrinsic apoptosis, indicating a connection between different cell-death pathways and promoting the concept of PANoptosis. [^2][^3]

post:
Under physiological conditions, VDAC1 is essential for cellular energy metabolism; it enables the bidirectional flow of ions, nucleotides (e.g., NAD+/NADH, ADP/ATP), and solutes smaller than 5 kDa. 

VDAC1 in a pathological context shows itself as a key player in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. 

Wan and colleagues provide an important notion that the VDAC1 is a side player in necroptosis. VDAC1 is a downstream molecule to MLKL. MLKL promotes its oligomerization, increases the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, and subsequently leakage of cytochrome c, mtDNA, intracellular Ca, and reactive oxygen species.
