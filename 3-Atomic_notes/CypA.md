# Notes
Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a DAMP that is released comparatively early outside the cell compared to the well-known HMGB1. Christofferson and Yuan speculated that CypA may be used as a valuable early marker of necrotic cell death, both regulated (necroptosis) and accidental (necrosis),  and moreover, it is not detected in apoptotic cell death samples treated with TNFα and CHX.
