Title: HDAC

# Notes
Histone deacetylases are essential epigenetic regulators that remove the acetyl group, thereby modifying gene transcription. Broadly the HDACs devided into two groups, classical (classes I, II, and IV) and non-classical (class III). This division depends on the metal ion Zn, which is essential for classical HDACs and the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), same importance for non-classical.
