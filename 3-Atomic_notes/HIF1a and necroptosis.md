Title: HIF1a and necroptosis
tags: #atomic_note #cell_death 


# Notes
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of over 100 genes involved in the cellular response to ischemic brain injury, including those linked to oxidative stress, cell death, and regeneration.

Under hypoxic conditions, both HIF-1α and BNIP3 are significantly upregulated and have been shown to promote necroptosis. Additionally, p53 activation can shift the balance from BNIP3-mediated necroptosis to apoptosis by disrupting cellular acidosis and suppressing BNIP3 and HIF-1α activity[^1].

Interestingly, Yang et al. demonstrated that inhibition of necroptosis—either by pharmacological blockade using GSK’872 or by RIPK3 knockdown with siRNA—reduces both necroptosis signaling and HIF-1α expression in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic stroke[^2]. However, direct inhibition of HIF-1α did not significantly alter necroptosis markers, suggesting that HIF-1α may act as a downstream effector rather than a primary initiator of necroptotic signaling.

Conversely, Karshovska et al. reported that HIF-1α positively regulates necroptosis in macrophages, possibly through a shift in mitochondrial function from ATP production to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in LPS-stimulated macrophages[^3]. Furthermore, HIF-1α was shown to promote necroptosis in dermal fibroblasts, an effect that was reversed by HIF-1α inhibition[^4]. These findings suggest that HIF-1α can actively induce or sustain necroptosis under certain conditions.

In conclusion, the dual role of HIF-1α in necroptosis may depend on its expression levels, the severity of hypoxic stress, and cell-type–specific factors.
