Title: PTEN and ferroptosis
tags: #atomic_note #cell_death 


# Notes
PTEN knockdown is a well-known model of steatohepatitis. Due to oxidative stress caused by the dysregulation of PTEN, most cells choose ferroptosis over other regulated cell death types.

At minimum, in the context of hepatocytes, PTEN inhibits ferroptosis. Or more specifically, create a good state that does not lead to cell death.
