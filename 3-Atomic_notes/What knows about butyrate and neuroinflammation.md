In conclusion, these results not only suggest that **propionic acid** may be a potential biomarker for PD, but also indicate the possibility that PD may be treated by altering circulating levels of SCFA.[16]

Microglia play a vital role maintaining brain homeostasis but can also cause persistent neuroinflammation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the intestinal microbiota have been suggested to regulate microglia inflammation indirectly by signaling through the gut-brain axis or directly by reaching the brain. The present work evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of SCFAs on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia from mice fed inulin, a soluble fiber that is fermented by intestinal microbiota to produce SCFAs in vivo, and SCFAs applied to primary microglia in vitro. Feeding mice inulin increased SCFAs in the cecum and in plasma collected from the hepatic portal vein. Microglia isolated from mice fed inulin and stimulated with LPS in vitro secreted less tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) compared to microglia from mice not given inulin. Additionally, when mice were fed inulin and injected i.p with LPS, the ex vivo secretion of TNF-α by isolated microglia was lower than that secreted by microglia from mice not fed inulin and injected with LPS. Similarly, in vitro treatment of primary microglia with acetate and butyrate either alone or in combination downregulated microglia cytokine production with the effects being additive. SCFAs reduced histone deacetylase activity and nuclear factor-κB nuclear translocation after LPS treatment in vitro. Whereas microglia expression of SCFA receptors Ffar2 or Ffar3 was not detected by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, the SCFA transporters Mct1 and Mct4 were. Nevertheless, inhibiting monocarboxylate transporters on primary microglia did not interfere with the anti-inflammatory effects of SCFAs, suggesting that if SCFAs produced in the gut regulate microglia directly it is likely through an epigenetic mechanism following diffusion.][11]

Serum short chain fatty acids mediate hippocampal BDNF and correlate with decreasing neuroinflammation following high pectin fiber diet in mice][13]

The probable protection mechanism of butyrate treatment occurs through NRF2 through Nrf2 and HIF-1α activation and consequent activation of catalase and superoxide dismutase. Our data suggest that systemic inflammation associated with intestinal barrier disruption in UC leads to neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex, which was atenuated by butyrate.[15]

B. producta-derived butyrate demonstrated the inhibition of microglial activation in PD through regulation of the RAS-NF-κB pathway.[17]

 These findings suggest an association between neuroinflammation and decreased levels of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate that is one of the major gut microbial metabolites having a potentially beneficial role in brain homeostasis.[18]

# Complex study
MPTP-induced lower propionic acid and isobutyric acid, and higher butyric acid and valeric acid and other metabolites.[5]
 propionate and butyrate enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and promote early neurogenic differentiation of neural stem cells through reactive oxygen species- and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2-dependent mechanism.[8]
  Mice models were established under low temperature (LT), room temperature (RT), high temperature (HT), and temperature variation (TV) respectively for seven days.  LT increased the expressions of acetate and propionate while decreased that of NLRP3 inflammasomes; HT decreased the expression of butyrate while increased that of NLRP3 inflammasomes, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α; TV decreased the expression of propionate while increased that of NLRP3 inflammasomes and TNF-α.[9]

NaB prevented the increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression in LPS-stimulated primary microglia. The GPR109A/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway was found to be involved in the activation of antioxidant response of primary microglia induced by sodium butyrate.[22]
