Title: Autophagy and necroptosis
tags: #atomic_note #cell_death 


# Notes
Liang et al. (2013) state that necroptosis plays an important role during ATP depletion in renal epithelial cells. The data show that, in the context of necroptosis induction (TNF + zVAD), autophagy is somehow emerging (LC3/GABDH ratio increase) and reduced if a RIPK1 inhibitor had been added. Late addition of Nec1 fails to ameliorate necroptosis in ATP depletion cases.

Ni, Y. _et al._ further promote the notion that necroptosis and autophagy are closely connected. They indicated that, during oxygen-glucose deprivation of astrocytes and neurons, both autophagy and necroptosis emerge, and RIPK1 inhibition, through transfection or Nec-1, leads to autophagy suppression. Moreover, the same results were obtained by Hong and colleagues in ischemia/reperfusion injury in the liver.

Prominent necroptosis molecules, as argued by other scholars, inhibit autophagy. They stimulate autophagy inhibitors such as mTOR, AMPK, and AKT, and deactivate ULK1 directly by phosphorylation.
