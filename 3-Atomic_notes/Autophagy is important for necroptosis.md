Title: Autophagy is important for necroptosis
Tags: #cell_death #atomic_note 


# Notes


Liang et al. (2013) state that necroptosis plays an important role during ATP depletion in renal epithelial cells. The data show that, in the context of necroptosis induction (TNF + zVAD), autophagy is somehow emerging (LC3/GABDH ratio increase) and reduced if a RIPK1 inhibitor had been added. Late addition of Nec1 fails to ameliorate necroptosis in ATP depletion cases.
# Summary
Pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy (3-MA and bafilomycin) and genetic knockdown of BECN1 and ATG7, in case of apoptosis deficiency, reduce necroptosis in response to cytotoxic treatment. 

Autophagy is correlated with necroptosis in the case of ATP depletion. Necroptosis, not apoptosis, is related to autophagy; moreover, inhibition of caspases somehow promotes autophagy.
