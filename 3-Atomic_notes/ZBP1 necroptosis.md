# Notes
Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), also known as DAI, is a protein that acts as a sensor for Z-nucleic acids (Z-DNA and Z-RNA) in the cell. ZBP1 possesses RIP homotypic interaction motifs of RIP3 and initiates necroptosis through the RIPK3/MLKL pathway. Lin et al. discover how ZBP1 promotes necroptosis during ischemic injury in hepatocytes.

The first logic question concerns the origin of Z-nucleic acids. The well-studied source of DNA is mitochondria; multiple studies have shown that these organelles are compromised during ischemia, and it is well-known that they have their own DNA. Lin and colleagues found that Z-DNA co-localizes at mitochondria at the early stage of hypoxia. 

However, Z-DNA is not a common isoform of DNA, so what mediates its occurrence? 
ROS-induced oxidative stress can promote the formation of Z-DNA in certain regions, including mitochondria. Hypoxia disrupts the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to electron leakage and an increase in mitochondrial ROS production. To confirm the suggestions, Lin's group uses ddV, a mitochondrial DNA scavenger, and MitoQ, a mitochondria ROS inhibitor. As a consequence of the treatment ZBP1/RIPK3 signaling pathway has been compromised. 

Overall, this information elucidated why in some cases during ischemia, inhibition of CASP8 is not essential, compared to compare with necroptosis mediated by TNFa.[^1]

Ischemic injury in hippocampal cells and in the MCAO/R model in mice simultaneously induces several cell death pathways, pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, also called PANoptosis via ZBP1. Increasing or decreasing the expression of ZBP1 inside the models changes the level of damage and the level of key executors of the pathways, respectively.[[@shuTargetingZbp1Ripk3Axis2025]]
