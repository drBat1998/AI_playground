# Notes

# Summary
AD is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects memory and eventually leads to global dementia. The two key hallmarks of the lesion are β-amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein neurofibillary tangles. In addition, the pathogenesis of the disease consists of neuronal loss, reduced synaptic density, and microglial and astrocyte activation. 
The disease usually starts in the medial temporal lobe.[^1]
