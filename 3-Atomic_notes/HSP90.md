Title: HSP90

# Notes
Heat shock protein 90α (HSP90α) is a molecular chaperone and plays a crucial role in protein folding, stabilization, and trafficking under both normal and stress conditions. Wang et al. showed that HSP90 could directly bind to RIPK3 and RIPK1 and promote their stability. Moreover, both pharmacological (geldanamycin) and genetic inhibition of HSP90α lead to decreased necroptosis and reduced expression of both active and inactive forms of RIP3 and MLKL, and reduced necrosome assembly (RIP1–RIP3 complex formation) in cortical neurons, HT-29, and PC-12 cell lines.[^1]
