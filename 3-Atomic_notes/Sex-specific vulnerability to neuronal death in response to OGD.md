Title: Sex-specific vulnerability to neuronal death in response to OGD
tags: #atomic_note #cell_death 


# Notes
Unlike societies in developed countries that have only recently begun to value both women and men equally, researchers studying ischemia tend to pay little attention to sex discrimination. Most common in vitro models of diseases typically include a mix of cells from both female and male rats or mice. 

However, nature often discriminates. Sharma and colleagues discovered that neurons respond differently to ischemia. Female mouse primary cerebellar granule neurons, compared to males, exhibit more significant cell death. XX CGNs subjected to OGD show higher caspase activity, increased mitochondrial permeability, and lower ATP levels. 

Therefore, sex differences in neuronal injury should be considered when designing experiments.
