Title: soluble Aβ oligomers
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
Although Aβ plaques are a crucial hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), accumulated evidence starting from 1998 by Lambert et al. indicated that soluble Aβ oligomers have a broad potential for neurotoxicity. In addition, compared to Aβ monomers, they can directly interact with lipid bilayers. Aβ fragments can spontaneously aggregate into soluble Aβ oligomers.

Additional data support the notion of the prominent role of soluble Aβ oligomers in neuronal toxicity during AD:
1. Monomeric Aβ has important physiological functions.
2. Knocking out APP, the precursor to Aβ, disrupts brain neurogenesis.
3. Accumulation of Aβ plaques in the brains of the elderly population does not always correlate with AD.
4. The plasma AβO concentration shows good accuracy as a marker in screening for AD.
5. The Osaka mutation of APP (E693 deletion) leads to the accumulation of AβO and AD pathology without the formation of Aβ plaques.
