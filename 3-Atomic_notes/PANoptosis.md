Title: PANoptosis
tags: #atomic_note #cell_death 


# Notes
In 2019, Kanneganti et al. suggested that specific triggers might induce multiple types of cell death (pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis) simultaneously, and they termed this phenomenon "PANoptosis". Researchers reported that the loss of a single component is insufficient to prevent cell death. [^1]
[[PANoptosome, key components]]
Gutierrez et al. confirmed that MLKL interacts with the NLRP3 inflammasome, which processes and activates IL-1β during necroptosis, indicating that necroptosis is linked to other forms of cell death like pyroptosis.[^2] In addition, Frank and Vince, in their review, said that RIPK3 promotes the IL1b release.

On the other hand, disruption of the inflammasome, the key component of both PANoptosis and pyroptosis, leads to even more inflammatory cell death governed by caspase-8 and RIPK3.
