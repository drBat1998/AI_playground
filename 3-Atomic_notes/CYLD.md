# Notes
CYLD (CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase) is a deubiquitinating enzyme (protease that removes ubiquitin). The enzyme has broad spectrum of target to regulate. Interestingly, CYLD influences the cell fate after TNFR (TNF receptor 1) activation.

Usually, TNFR activation leads to the assembly of one of the so-called complexes, each of which leads to a specific fate of the cell.  If nothing specifically influences the cell, or if the level of TNFR activation is low, the complex I is constructed. Complex I consists of TNF-receptor-associated factor 2, RIPK1, cIAP1, cIAP2, and LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex). cIAPs and LUBAC promote RIPK1 ubiquitination. This leads to creation of a platform that promotes NF-kb and MAPK pathway activation, and, as a consequence, cell survival and an inflammatory response. 

CYLD cleaves K63-linked polyubiquitin chains of RIPK1, to form the RIPK1/3 complex. This, as a consequence, promotes one of two types of cell death—apoptosis or necroptosis—depending on CASP8 activity.
