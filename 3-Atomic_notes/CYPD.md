# Notes
Cyclophilin D (CypD) is a protein found in mitochondria that plays a key role in regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). The mPTP is a large pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane. When it opens, it can cause the mitochondria to swell, leading to a loss of membrane potential, decreased ATP production.
