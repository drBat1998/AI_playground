Title: mtDNA
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
mtDNA is located close to the ETC complex and lacks histone protection, so mtDNA is vulnerable to ROS damage. Additionally, oxidative damage-mediated 8-hydroxyguanine and formamidopyrimidine modifications lead to G:C→ T:A transversion mutations in mtDNA, resulting in the formation of a mutated form of mtDNA that assumes a ZDNA conformation.
