Title: unicellular program cell death

# Notes
It is widely known throughout the biomedical community that cell death, especially programmed cell death, plays an essential role in maintaining homeostasis. However, few know that programmed suicide may also occur in unicellular organisms. Madeo et al. [^1] were among the first to show that disruption of intracellular homeostasis leads to cell death that has similar markers as apoptosis, including DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine exposure. I think that this notion opens a set of interesting questions, including the function of specific molecules in apoptosis, such as phosphatidylserine. The exposure occurs in the absence of macrophages, so it has a function other than serving as a red flag for deletion.
