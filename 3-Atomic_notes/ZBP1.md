# Notes
Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), also known as DAI, is a protein that acts as a sensor for Z-nucleic acids (Z-DNA and Z-RNA) in the cell. It plays a crucial role in the innate immune response, particularly in antiviral defense and inflammatory cell death. ROS-induced oxidative stress can alter DNA structure, potentially favoring the formation of Z-DNA in certain region.
