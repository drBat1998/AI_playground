Title: PTEN and cell death
tags: #atomic_note #cell_death 


# Notes
In seminoma cells (tumor cells potentially harboring defects in apoptosis-related genes), PTEN induces a form of regulated cell death characterized by necrotic morphology.  Guido et al. demonstrated that PTEN, a well-known tumor suppressor, promotes cell death in seminoma cells, likely through the upregulation of autophagy-related genes. The authors suggested that this process leads to necrotic-like cell death. Given the caspase-independent nature of this death and its necrotic characteristics, the authors hypothesized that it may involve parthanatos. However, since parthanatos and necroptosis were not yet fully distinguished as separate types of regulated cell death in 2010, the observed phenomenon might also represent necroptosis.
