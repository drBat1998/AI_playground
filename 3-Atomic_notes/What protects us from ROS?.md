Reactive oxygen species are a group of very important molecules, that like a sharp blade can play a dual role. They could be friends who protect us from bacteria and foes who damage our DNA. Superoxide radicals, hydroxy peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals are well known to promote great damage to cells, the property is derived from their ability to give "unnecessary" ions to everyone in "need". Evolution creates robust and sophisticated systems to protect the cell. 
Two main systems that play that essential role are SOD (superoxide dismutase) and glutathione peroxidase systems. The superoxide dismutase system consists of superoxide dismutase itself, which transforms superoxide radicals into hydroxy peroxide, and catalase which continues reduction to water and oxygen. In the case of glutathione peroxidase, the system is more robust. It consists of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and NADPH as a key component, and a cause of why mutation in the penthose cycle could lead to big problems with red blood cells. 
It is quite fascinating but cell components in some way also play a protective role against ROS. This phenomenon is called structural antioxidants.
