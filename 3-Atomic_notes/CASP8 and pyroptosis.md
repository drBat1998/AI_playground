Title: CASP8 and pyroptosis

# Notes
Chen and colleagues showed that pyroptosis is a component in the pathogenesis of retinal ischemia. Genetic blockage or reduction of key components of pyrotosis, including GSDM, CASP1, NLRP12, NLRP3, and NLRC4, leads to a significant increase in cell survival in an ischemic context. It is interesting, but not unexpected information. The notion that truly inspired me was that CASP8 is involved in pyroptosis during ischemia. 

Caspase 8 is a well-known gatekeeper that determines the specific type of cell death, namely, extrinsic apoptosis or necroptosis. Chen and all increase the complexity of the CASP8 function. They provide evidence for other CASP8 functions upstream in the promotion of pyroptosis. This discovery further supports PANoptosis existence in some contexts, namely, the cooperation of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, but not cocuration.[^1] 


Recent findings identify FADD and caspase-8 as central regulators of both canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation. They control the process at two levels: (1) transcriptional priming, by promoting NF-κB-mediated upregulation of Nlrp3 and pro-IL-1β; and (2) post-translational activation, by interacting with inflammasome components such as ASC and promoting the activation of caspase-1. Under inflammasome stimuli (e.g., LPS+ATP, LPS+nigericin), caspase-8 is processed and contributes to IL-1β and IL-18 secretion. This role becomes especially prominent when canonical caspase-1/11 pathways are blocked. Notably, FADD and caspase-8 are required for the full activation of both NLRP3 arms in response to pathogens, and their absence (along with RIPK3) significantly impairs inflammasome activity.[^2]
