Title: Epidemiology of Stroke
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally and the third leading cause of disability. In the last few decades, incidents of ischemic stroke have increased in younger people. This elevation may be due to several reasons, including more sophisticated bioimaging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted MRI, and increased preventable risk factors among young ones. The young generation been exposed to obesity, smoking, poor diet, and lack of physical activity.  [[@baronCorePenumbraModel2021]]
