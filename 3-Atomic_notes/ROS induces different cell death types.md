Title: ROS induces different cell death types
tags: #atomic_note #cell_death 



# Notes
Wang et al. postulate that a low amount of ROS induces apoptosis, while a large amount promotes necroptosis, and necroptosis further increases in a dose-dependent manner in L8824 cells. [^1]
Tong et al., on the other hand, promote the notion that different reagents that induce ROS elevation may induce different cell death types. In the paper, they say ROS promotes necroptosis and ferroptosis in RPE cells, but not pyroptosis or apoptosis, so this evidence suggests that ROS induces cell death in cell cell-specific way as well.[^2]
