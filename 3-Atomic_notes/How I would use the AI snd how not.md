Title: How I would use the AI snd how not
tags: #atomic_note 


Artificial intelligence is a broad topic consisting of many different approaches. Also, the technology is dangerous, the complete blockage of it does not provide anything valuable either, and puts me at a disadvantage compared to those who would use it. So, I want to think about a set of rules for its usage

Mindless usage is not an option. It can only demage thinking ability and introduce foolish mistakes in my writing. In addition, the piece of writing would be heartless and would not resemble anything from you, nor your experience nor your unique thoughts only artificial algorithms. 

Green-light uses of generative AI consist of spelling and grammar correction, creating a person with views opposite to mine to increase critique and further strengthen my arguments, explaining parts where I have no or little expertise, and automating manual and unnecessary tasks.

"Yellow light" I would give to brainstorming ideas, such as creating a name for the articles. Finding the information may be useful, but the possibility of misleading information is something I should be cautious about.

Red, or forbidden, use cases for AI would be creating the first draft, completely writing the piece of work without your control, and summarizing the text. It is obvious that generation of a first draft and summarizing the text do not give anything to your brain's ability, and even more, the AI can be delusional or its perspective may be opposite to yours.
