Title: necroptosis DAMPs
tags: #atomic_note #cell_death 


# Notes
In contrast to apoptosis, which if the apoptotic bodies would be shortly removed by macrophages, show litlt immune response; necroptosis leads to rubust immune response. Moreover, during apoptosis caspases cleave various molecules (e.g., PLA2, IL-33, HMGB1), reducing their immunogenicity. Necroptosis, by contrast, lacks caspase activity and is characterized by plasma membrane rupture, lysosomal leakage, and release of intact nuclei and organelles. This leads to an abundant and more immunogenic pool of DAMPs, including full-length IL-33, mtDNA, and reduced HMGB1.
