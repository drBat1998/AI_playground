# Notes
Parthanatos is a form of programmed cell death with necrotic morphology induced by rapid PARP1 activation, leading to PAR accumulation, mitochondria disruption, and AIF translocation to the nucleus, and induces large-scale DNA fragmentation. PAR accumulation and treatment are sufficient for AIF release from mitochondria.
