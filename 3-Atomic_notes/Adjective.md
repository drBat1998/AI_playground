# Notes
An adjective is a word that describes or modifies a noun.
When adjectives are used together, you should separate them with a comma or a conjunction. 

Adjectives have three forms:
absolute - describing one thing - cool gay
comparative - comparing two things - cooler gay
superlative - indicating the highest degree - coolest gay

Coordinate adjectives should be separated by a comma or the word and. 

Order of adjectives
1. opinion
2. size
3. age
4. shape
5. color
6. origin
7. material
8. purpose

Compound adjectives
- Combine two or more words to act as a single descriptor for a noun.
- usually linked with hyphens
- when the compound adjective follows the noun, the hyphen is typically dropped.
