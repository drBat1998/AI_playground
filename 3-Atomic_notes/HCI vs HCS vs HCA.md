Title: HCI vs HCS vs HCA
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
High-Content Imaging (HCI) is a combination of automated microscopy, fluorescent detection, and multiparameter algorithms to measure and monitor phenotypic changes. 

High content screening (HCS) is input of multiple profiles at the same time in the same sample well.

High content analysis(HCA) is a multiparameter algorithm applied to HCI data.
