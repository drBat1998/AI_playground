Title: Autophagy and cell death

# Notes

Autophagy is important for maintaining regulated cell death(RCD). RCD is an energy-dependent process, so logically, the diminishing of stress-related energy sources, such as autophagy, reduces the cell suicide level. Even if, in general, autophagy is a mechanism for cell survival. For example, during cancer treatment, inhibition of this important process, both by genetic and pharmacological means, leads to an increase in cancer cell resistance[^1]. 

Autophagy during ischemia plays a conxtroversial role. Energy deficiency promotes autophagy to protect cells during starvation. But during prolonged hypoxia/ischemia, autophagy starts to play a deteriorating role. Neuronal cell death, caspase-dependent and independent, that occurs during ischemic injury, is based on autophagy. Koike et al. showed that in Atg7-deficient mice, the severity of damage in the hippocampus drastically reduces [^2]

Kasprowska and colleagues used an autophagy inhibitor in the context of oxygen-glucose deprivation in astrocytes. The results suggest that autophagy inhibition leads to the elevation of both necroptosis and apoptosis in astrocytes.[^3]
