Title: Why barpots are nonsense or use two or more ways to represent your data
tags: #atomic_note #data_storytelling



# Notes
bar plots for example show only mean and error bars, so they usually misrepresent data. You lose distribution which is better shown in scatter plot or violin plot. Even barplot which shows useful information lacks modes, so you visualize your data as a standard distribution, but this is not always the case.
