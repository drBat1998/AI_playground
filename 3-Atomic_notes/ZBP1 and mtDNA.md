Title: ZBP1 and mtDNA
Tags: #atomic_note 


# Notes
mtDNA is a ligand for the ZBP1 receptor and may induce necroptosis, but not in all circumstances.

Nobuyuki et al. indicate that the ZBP1 receptor may even play a protective role. Cardiomyocytes respond to mtDNA administration by executing an inflammatory response without cell death. Interestingly, ZBP1 does not induce inflammation but instead inhibits it, suppressing RIPK3 and NLRP3. Furthermore, the authors reported the cardioprotective role of ZBP1 in the context of myocardial infarction.[^1]

In contrast, Zhao's group reported that myocardial infarction leads to necroptosis, and that knockout of ZBP1 ameliorates the expression of MLKL and RIPK3, which are key molecules of necroptosis.[^2]
