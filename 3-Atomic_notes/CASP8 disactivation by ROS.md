Title: CASP8 disactivation by ROS
tags: #atomic_note


# Notes
H2O2 inhibits recombinant caspase 3 and caspase 8 activity[^1] While small H2O2 promotes apoptosis, increase H2O2 concentration leads to significant caspase inhibition, and as consequence apoptosis[^3]. 

Hypothiocyanous acid generates reactive oxygen species. Combination of it with TNFa promotes necroptosis thorough caspase 8 inhibition.[^2]

Nitric oxide, crusial reactive nitrogen species, also inhibit caspase 8 activity by S-nitrosylation in vivo and in vitro both by an NO donor or through iNOS induction.  [^4]

Post:
Reactive oxygen species are a well-known trigger of apoptosis, regulated cell suicide. But if the reactive species levels continue to increase, cells may die in a more brutal way by regulated necrosis. Necrosis can damage nearby cells and spread inflammation. In some way, it's like comparing suicide by drug overdose to falling in front of a train in the subway. Overdose just influences a person and his relatives' lives, whereas falling in the subway ruins the day for thousands of people.
