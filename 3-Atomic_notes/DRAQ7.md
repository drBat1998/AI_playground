Title: DRAQ7

# Notes
DRAQ7 offers significant advantages over propidium iodide (PI) as a cell viability dye because it is a far-red fluorescent stain that is non-toxic to cells, can be used in long-term, real-time cell monitoring, and has spectral properties that prevent overlap with other common fluorescent markers.

0.35–10 uM DRAQ7 was undertaken to assess the impact of the probe on cell viability. Importantly, even a 20 lM concentration of DRAQ7 proved to be nontoxic to both cell lines for up to 72 h.
