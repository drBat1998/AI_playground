Title: ZBP1 vs RIPK1 in necroptosis
Tags: #atomic_note  #cell_death  


# Notes
Necroptosis key molecule RIPK3 is initiated through RHIM-mediated interaction; this domain was discovered in RIPK1, RIPK3, ZBP1, and TRIF. In the context of epidermal keratinocytes, TRIF is not essential for RIPK3 activation. Lin et al. indicated that RIPK1 deficiency leads to necroptosis in keratinocytes. The authors propose that RIPK1 suppresses necroptosis based on the finding that the RIPK1mRHIM mouse, which has a mutation in the RHIM motif, dies perinatally. 

Interestingly, besides RIPK3 and MLKL, which logically must mediate necroptosis, ZBP1 deficiency also reduces TUNEL+ keratinocytes in the epidermis of RIPK1KO mice. 

Diving deep into the interaction between RIPK1, RIPK3, and ZBP1, the authors showed that (1) disruption of the RHIM-dependent interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3 initiates necroptosis; (2) RIPK1 did not interact with ZBP1 directly in the keratinocyte context;  (3) deleting ZBP1 in these RIPK1mRHIM/E-KO mice prevented the skin disease. 

Overall, these data suggest that RIPK1 and ZBP1 are rivals for interaction with RIPK3. Under normal circumstances, RIPK1 suppresses RIPK3-dependent necroptosis. 


New data showes that ZBP1 interacts with RIPK1 in hepatocytes[^1] during steatotic liver I/R
