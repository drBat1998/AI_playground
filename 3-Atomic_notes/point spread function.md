Title: point spread function
tags: #atomic_note #microscopy 


# Notes
When the microscope images a dot, it is not represented as a dot, but as a point spread function. It is represented as a bright central spot surrounded by faint circular rings. The smaller this central spot, the better, and it depends on the [[numerical aperture]].
