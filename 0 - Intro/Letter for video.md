# Notes
Hello, 
my name is Roman Koval. I am a PhD student of BIPH NAS Ukraine. I was deeply imprested and interested in your reserch:
Plemel JR, Caprariello AV, Keough MB, Henry TJ, Tsutsui S, Chu TH, Schenk GJ, Klaver R, Yong VW, Stys PK. Unique spectral signatures of the nucleic acid dye acridine orange can distinguish cell death by apoptosis and necroptosis. J Cell Biol. 2017 Apr 3;216(4):1163-1181. doi: 10.1083/jcb.201602028. Epub 2017 Mar 6. PMID: 28264914; PMCID: PMC5379938.

In following month I intend to take part of course called 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗡𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗶, organized by the 𝘕𝘎𝘖 “𝘉𝘪𝘰𝘪𝘯𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘴 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘜𝘬𝘳𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘦” https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bioinformatics-for-ukraine_dear-colleagues-and-friends-hope-you-had-activity-7370105645636804608-HlhT?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADTFiNwB_61t_28mMDeL-jPg4txLLFLTDGo
They encourage bring own data for analysis, but unfortunatly the microscope that can help replicate your study is not avalible. Could you please share your image data for my training. 

Best regards,
