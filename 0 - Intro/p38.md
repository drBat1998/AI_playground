The p38 family is a highly evolutionarily conserved group of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that is involved in and helps co-ordinate cellular responses to nearly all stressful stimuli.  

p38α (originally named p38) was identified and cloned as a 38 kDa protein that was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to LPS stimulation in mammalian cells.


There are four members of the p38 group of MAPKs encoded by four different genes in mammals: 
- p38α ( MAPK14, chromosome 6p21.31 in humans), 
- p38β ( MAPK11, SAPK2b, Chr22q13.33), 
- p38γ ( MAPK12, ERK6, SAPK3, Chr22q13.33), 
- p38δ ( MAPK13, SAPK4, Serk4, Chr6p21.31) 

Activation and inactivation of p38
p38α is involved in the response to almost all stressful stimuli, including LPS, UV light, heat shock, osmotic shock, inflammatory cytokines, T cell receptor ligation, glucose starvation, and oncogene activation.

Like other MAPK signaling pathways, the activation of all p38s is mediated by a kinase cascade:
MAPKKK (MAP3K), which activates MAPKK (MAP2K), which in turn activates MAPK. 
The MAP2K kinases MKK3 and MKK6 are the major upstream kinases for p38 activation 

p38α can also be activated by MAP2K-independent mechanisms.
TAB1 (TAK1-binding protein 1) directly interacts with p38α and can promote trans autophosphorylation on Thr 180 and Tyr 182 and thus full activation of p38α. AB1-dependent p38α activation has been implicated in ischemic myocardial injury and T cell anergy

Conversely, de-phosphorylation of both threonine and tyrosine residues in the activation loop inactivates MAPKs, and this is mainly carried out by dual-specificity phosphatases of the MAPK phosphatase (MKP)/dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family 42. Although several MKPs have been reported to dephosphorylate p38α, MKP1/DUSP1, MKP5/DUSP10, MKP8/DUSP26, and DUSP8 are more potent inhibitors of p38α and JNK than ERK 43.

Downstream substrates of p38
Protein kinases
- Members of the MAPK-activated protein kinase (MAPKAPK) family such as MK2, MK3, and MK5 (PRAK) are all p38 substrates
- Mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1/2 (MSK1/2), which are important for CREB activation and chromosome remodeling, have also been identified as substrates of p38α
Transcription factors
- p38 targets a large number of transcription factors, including myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family members, cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor 1, 2, and 6 (ATF-1/2/6), CHOP (growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 153, or GADD153), p53, C/EBPβ, MITF1, DDIT3, ELK1/4, NFAT, and STAT1/4.

Biological functions of the p38 pathway
Embryo development
- p38α is required for embryo development, since the mouse Mapk14 –/– embryo dies between embryonic days (E) 10.5 and 12.5
- Histological analysis demonstrates that p38α is required for placental angiogenesis, but not embryonic cardiovascular development, and tetraploid rescue of the placental defect in Mapk14 –/– embryos confirmed that p38α is essential for extraembryonic development 
Immune responses
- Macrophage-specific deletion of Mapk14 inhibits inflammatory cytokine production and protects mice from CLP-induced sepsis
- p38α controls the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-6, at many levels. It directly phosphorylates transcription factors, such as MEF2C 62, 186, and regulators of mRNA stability, such as hnRNPK-homology (KH) type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) 187. MEF2C appears to play an anti-inflammatory role in endothelial cells in vivo 188. Via MK2/MK3, p38 also upregulates cytokine mRNA transcription by the serum response transcription factor (SRF) 189, and similarly, via MK2/MK3, p38 regulates mRNA stability by phosphorylating and inactivating TTP/Zfp36, a protein that promotes rapid turnover of AU-rich mRNAs, many of which are cytokine mRNAs 187, 190. 
Cell cycle and Cell senescence
- 38α activity is responsible for senescence induced by multiple stimuli, such as telomere shortening 225, 226, H 2O 2 exposure 227, 228, and chronic oncogene activation 
- 
Cell differentiation
- p38α activity is essential for neuronal differentiation in PC-12 cells and EPO-induced differentiation in SKT6 cells
Cell metabolism
- The p38β–PRAK axis specifically phosphorylates Rheb and suppresses mTORC1 activity under energy depletion conditions
Cell survival and death
- Recent studies show that p38-activated MK2 directly phosphorylates RIPK1 in TNF-treated cells or pathogen-infected cells, limiting TNF-induced cell death 180– 182. This represents an interesting link between cytokine production induced by TNF and cell death because TNF-induced MK2/MK3 phosphorylation of tristetraprolin/Zfp36 inactivates it and leads to increased stability of cytokine mRNAs 190. Aberrant p38α activity is observed in many tumor cells, and inhibition of p38α/β enhances cell death in these cell
