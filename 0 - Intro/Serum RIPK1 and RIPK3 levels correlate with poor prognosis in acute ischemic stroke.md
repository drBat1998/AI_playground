Title: Serum RIPK1 and RIPK3 levels correlate with poor prognosis in acute ischemic stroke
Tags: #


# Notes
Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a common cerebrovascular disease with high mortality. AIS patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) often have severe conditions that require close monitoring and timely treatment. Receptor‐interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3 play important roles in cell apoptosis and inflammation. However, the relevance of serum RIPK1/3 to AIS patients in the ICU has not been clarified. One hundred and twenty AIS patients were selected as the research subjects for the retrospective analysis. The subjects were grouped based on the volume of cerebral infarction and the score of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and mRS. The correlation was explored using Pearson analysis. The predictive value was valued using the ROC curve. The content of serum RIPK1 and RIPK3 was gradually elevated with increased cerebral infarction volume and the severity of the disease (p < 0.05). Patients with poor prognosis had a higher content of serum RIPK1 and RIPK3 than those with good prognosis (p < 0.05). Serum RIPK1 and RIPK3 levels were positively correlated with infarct volume, NHISS, and mRS scores (p < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) of RIPK1 and RIPK3 for predicting the severity of AIS was 0.703, 0.883, and 0.912, respectively. The AUC for predicting poor prognosis of AIS was 0.797, 0.721, and 0.893, respectively. The cooperative detection of RIPK1 and RIPK3 had higher clinical value.
# Summary
Dong and Xiong showed that during acute ischemic stroke in the intensive care unit RIPK1 and RIPK3 serum level positibly corelates with the damage volume, the severity of the disease, and the bad prognosis.
