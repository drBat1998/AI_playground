# RNA isolation procedure for cells and tissue
## Equipment
1. Microcentrifuge
2. Fridge 
3. Homogenizer
4. Vortexer
5. -20°C freezer
6. -80°C freezer
## Reagents
1. Ice-cold PBS
2. TRIzol
3. Chloroform
4. Isopropanol
5. 75% ethanol
6. DEPC treated H2O/water or DEPC treated TE buffer

## Procedure
1. Aspirate the media - Using at least 10^6 cells, aspirate the media and wash once with ice-cold PBS (1–2 mL).  [[What should I do when less number of cells are available?]]
2. Aspirate the PBS (remove as much as possible) and add 1 mL TRIzol.
3. Scrape the plate briefly, then remove the TRIzol with a pipette and deposit the TRIzol/cell lysate into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.  
4. Leave at room temperature for 5 min
5. Add 250 µl chloroform and shake the tube vigorously for about 15 sec.
6. Leave at room temperature for 5 min
7. Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C
	Having your samples spin at 4°C helps reduce RNA degradation. If you don’t have access to a refrigerated centrifuge, you can carefully bring a centrifuge into a cold room for centrifugation. Once you’re done using the centrifuge, bring this equipment back to room temperature, as prolonged storage in the cold room may damage it.
8. Carefully remove the aqueous phase using a pipette.
	At this point, there will be three layers in each tube:
	Top layer: clear, aqueous
	Middle layer/interphase: white precipitated DNA
	Bottom layer: pink organic phase

	Carefully remove the aqueous phase using a pipette. 
	Leave behind some of the aqueous phase (about 1 mm above DNA layer to prevent DNA contamination).
	Place in another 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.
	==**Avoid working with large pipettes here**==, as it is harder to control the rate and force of fluid withdrawal and this increases the likelihood of drawing some of the organic or DNA phase.
9. Add 550 µl isopropanol to the aqueous phase and mix gently.
	==**To improve the yield of RNA, instead of incubating at -20°C for 1 hour, you can try incubating at -80°C overnight**==
10. Leave at room temperature for 5 min
11. Centrifuge at maximal speed (14,000 rpm) for 20 min at 4°C
	==**If a low yield is expected, centrifuge for 30 min**==
12. Place samples on ice
13. Then pour off the isopropanol and add 1 mL 75% ethanol in DEPC-treated H2O.
14. Mix gently.
15. Recentrifuge at 9,500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C
16. Pour off the ethanol and let the pellets air-dry
	 ==**It is important to not let the pellet get too dry before resuspending, as this affects the solubility of the RNA.**==
	 To prevent overdrying, watch the pellet and carefully remove any residual ethanol wash and add RNase-free water or TE as soon as the entire tube is dried but while the white pellet is still visible.
17. Centrifuge the tubes to quicken the evaporation
	 After pouring off the bulk of the ethanol wash, there will be approximately 30–40 µl left in the bottom of the Eppendorf tube.
	 To quicken the evaporation, centrifuge the tubes briefly to force the remaining fluid on the side of the tube to the bottom, then pipette off as much of the ethanol as is feasible. 
18. Add approximately 15–25 µl (depending on yield) of either DEPC-treated TE buffer or water to the RNA pellet.
19. To a small Eppendorf tube, dilute the RNA 1/40 (1.2 µl in 48.8 µl of TE buffer) and add to a microcuvette (path length = 1 cm).
20. Then measure the absorbance at 260 nm.  - The 260/280 ratio should be greater than 1.8. If less than 1.5–1.6 or so, the RNA is likely to be at least partially degraded. Lower ratios also suggest DNA or thiocyanate contamination. The concentration is essentially the equivalent of the OD at 260 nm (in µg/µl).
21. Store your RNA sample(s) at -80 °C to prevent RNA degradation and avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles. ==**To avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles of your entire RNA sample, consider making smaller aliquots of it and storing those in -80°C.**==
