The human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and differentiated into a neuronal-like phenotype by treatment with 50 µM retinoic acid (Sigma Aldrich, Milano, Italy) for 10–12 days, a condition known to induce mitotic arrest [28].[^1]


The human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell line was purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The cells from a
single donor culture were plated and grown at 37 °C in a humidi®ed
atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% O2 in D-MEM medium (Seromed,
BIOSPA, Milan) supplemented with foetal calf serum (Gibco, Italy),
4 mM glutamine and 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (D-MEM+).
Cells were used till the 50th passage in culture.
For differentiation, cells were plated into poly L-lysine-coated
dishes at a density ranging from 6.5 3 103 to 50 3 103 cells per cm2
and grown as monolayer in D-MEM+.
Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were incubated in fresh
D-MEM+ with 10 mM RA in ethanol or ethanol alone. The medium
was changed on alternate days, and cultures were allowed to
differentiate for 2 weeks.[^2]

SK-N-SH cells (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) high glucose (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 1x penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (PSG) and 1x sodium pyruvate at 37 °C and 5 % CO2. The medium was changed every 3 days and 80 - 90 % confluent monolayers were passaged by 0.25 % Trypsin-EDTA (Merck). Cells were incubated for 3 min with Trypsin-EDTA, neutralized with medium and centrifuged for 3 min at 300 rpm.

Differentiation by RA
All-trans retinoic acid (RA) was dissolved in DMSO (10 mM). For differentiation, cells were plated into poly-L-ornithine-coated (0.01 %, Merck) wells at a density of 4.5 x 104 cells / cm2 and incubated for 24 h in the previously described media. To increase the sensitivity, cell number was increased to 3 x 105 cells / cm2 for intracellular Ca2+ recordings. Subsequently, the medium was changed to the differentiation medium (DMEM + 2.5 % FBS + 1x PSG + 10 µM RA, according to literature [28]). Cells were incubated with RA for 14 days with exchange of media every 48 h.[^3]


The NB cells, SK-N-SH obtained from ATCC (Virginia,USA) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with PenStrep, and 10% FBS (Invitrogen; 10270106) at 37 °C in a humidifed 5% CO2 incubator.
