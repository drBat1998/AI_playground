# Notes
1. Do not be a good guy. ([[nice guy]])
2. To be good is not to be yourself but to be a slave to others. 
3. Carrien on your and other baggage throughout your life. Your baggage is what you think and do, the other baggage is what they think about your action.
4. Courage and authenticity against good and covurdness.
