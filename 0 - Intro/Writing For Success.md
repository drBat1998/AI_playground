Rhetorical Analysis
https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/oregonwrites/chapter/backpacks-v-briefcases-steps-toward-rhetorical-analysis/
We start making assumptions about the person at first glance. Our brain does it more or less unconsciously. Understanding of rhetorical messages is essential to make you an informed consumer. Rhetoric uses authority (ethos), emotion (pathos).
The Rhetorical Situation, Or Discerning Context. Lloyd Bitzer argues that there are three parts to understanding the context of a rhetorical moment: exigence, audience and constraints. Exigence is the circumstance or condition that invites a response; in order to understand exigence, you should ask the following questions:  “What is this rhetoric responding to?” “What might have happened to make the rhetor (the person who creates the rhetoric) respond in this way?”
Audience is who we refer to in response to the issue, and should be able to help solve the problem in some way.  The constraints of the rhetorical situation are those things that have the power to “constrain decision and action needed to modify the exigence.”
