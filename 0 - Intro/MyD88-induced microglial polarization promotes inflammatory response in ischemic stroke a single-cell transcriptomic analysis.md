Recension of MyD88-induced microglial polarization promotes inflammatory response in ischemic stroke: a single-cell transcriptomic analysis

Positive Aspects:
The manuscript addresses an important and timely topic by investigating the role of MyD88-mediated microglial polarization in post-stroke inflammation, an area of high relevance for developing targeted therapies in ischemic stroke. The use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in combination with experimental validation (qPCR, ELISA, Transwell assays) is a clear strength, as it integrates bioinformatics insights with functional assays to support the conclusions. The authors effectively identify a MyD88+ microglial subpopulation and link its activity to inflammatory signaling pathways, providing potential translational implications for targeting MyD88 in stroke therapy. The study is well-structured in its overall design and has the potential to contribute valuable data to the field upon addressing the noted concerns.

Minor concerns:
1. Language:
Microglias → “Microglia
Post-ischemic stroke changes?
“post-ischemic stroke (IS) inflammation” → “post-ischemic inflammation”.

Major concerns:
1. Insufficient methodological details
Sample characteristics and selection criteria need an explicit description: The term “HI” is not explicitly defined, as well as the species that have been selected for transcriptomic analysis.  
BV-2 cells: passage numbers used.
Results obtained using LPS may not fully translate to ischemic conditions.
Sequence and supplier of si-MYD88 and si-NC.
Transfection reagent and protocol (amount per well, incubation time).
cDNA synthesis protocol (kit, RNA input amount) is not described.
The primer table is incomplete:
Primers are listed without gene labels and incomplete structure. Confirm reference gene (likely GAPDH).
 ELISA: Dilution factors used for supernatants. Replicates per group (n=?).
 Statistical Analysis: Why a t-test if we have four groups in in vitro studies? Number of biological and technical replicates for each assay.

2. Results require quantitative clarity
Report exact p-values, fold changes, and n values for key findings (MyD88 knockdown effects on cytokine levels, endothelial migration).

4. Discussion lacks contextual depth
While the study demonstrates MyD88’s role, there is limited discussion on how these findings extend or differ from existing TLR4-MyD88 studies in stroke models.
The potential limitations of scRNA-seq (batch effects, sample size limitations) and the in vitro system (BV-2 cells vs. primary microglia) should be discussed.

Condition to be published:
The manuscript has the potential to contribute valuable insights into post-stroke inflammation mechanisms; however, it requires major revisions prior to publication. Specifically, the authors must:
1. Substantially improve the English language and terminology consistency throughout the manuscript.
2. Expand and clarify methodological details to ensure reproducibility, including explicit descriptions of sample characteristics, experimental protocols, reagent details, and statistical methods.
3. Provide quantitative clarity in the results, reporting exact p-values, fold changes, and replicate numbers for all key findings.
 4. Expand the discussion to position the findings within the context of existing TLR4-MyD88 literature and discuss the limitations of the scRNA-seq and in vitro models used.

Upon satisfactory revision addressing these concerns, the manuscript could be considered suitable for publication.
