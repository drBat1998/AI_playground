# 2.1 Neurons
## 2.1.1 Neuronal Atrophy and Neuronal Loss
- In atrophy, the cell body shrinks, cytoplasm shows diffuse basophilia and nucleus becomes dark or pyknotic. 
- Neuronal loss is recognised by the accompanying increase in glial cells (gliosis), but sometimes may need detailed quantitative analysis. 
- Atrophy and loss are commonly seen in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases.

Neuronal degeneration 
- chronic
- hard to detact 
- best indicated by presence of reactive glial changes.
## 2.1.2 Hypoxic-Ischaemic Change
"red (dead) neurons"—shrunken neurons (cell body shrinkage) with intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm, loss of Nissl substance, darkly stained pyknotic nucleus (which may eventually fragment/undergo karyorrhexis) and loss of nucleoli (Fig. 2.1a).

The red neurons are not specific to hypoxia/ ischaemia, but can also be seen in hypoglycaemia and excitotoxic injury. 
Neurons in some locations are more vulnerable to hypoxic-ischaemic injury than others e.g. pyramidal neurons of hippocampus, cortical pyramidal neurons, and cerebellar Purkinje neurons.

The dead neurons may sometimes be encrusted with minerals such as calcium and iron (termed ‘ferrugination’), commonly seen in infant brains with hypoxic-ischaemic injury.

Red neurons
- acute injury (ischemia, hypoglycemia)
- shrunken cell border
- intence cytoplasmic eosynophilia
- nuclear pyknosis ![[Pasted image 20250714125600.png]]
- loss of Nissl substance
## 2.1.3 Chromatolysis
This feature refers to the response to injury and is recognised by the presence of a distended neuron with pale cytoplasm, loss or redistribution of Nissl substance and eccentric location of the nucleus. This change is usually seen in large lower motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord secondary to axonal damage. A similar change in neurons referred as ‘ballooned or swollen neurons’ can be seen in a wide variety of neurodegenerative, metabolic and developmental disorders
