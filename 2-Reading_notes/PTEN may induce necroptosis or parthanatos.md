Title: PTEN may induce necroptosis or parthanatos

# Notes

# Summary
In human seminoma cell line PTEN upregulation leads to increased autophagy and cell death. While the author states that the PTEN induces necroptosis, but just RIPK1 is not sufficient to prove it. Amount of RAPK1 doesn't give sufficient data to prove parthanatosis involvement in this process as well. However, this information is sufficient to tell that in these cells PTEN overexpression is not involved in apoptosis.
