Title: Propionic acids promote glial differentiation
Tags: #SCFAs #reading_note 


# Notes
PPA promotes glial cells differentiation in vitro.   **Butyrate and propionate have opposite effects on hNSCs differentiation. Propionic acids shift differentiation to GFAP cells while butyrate to neurons.**
# Summary
Propionic acids in a concentration of 0.5 mM and higher promote astrocytes differentiation.
