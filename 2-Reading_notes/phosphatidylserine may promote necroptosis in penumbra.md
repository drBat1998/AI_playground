Title: phosphatidylserine may promote necroptosis in penumbra
Tags: #reading_note #cell_death 


# Notes

# Summary
In this study, Annexin V was used as a treatment. The probable treatment target is phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure. The authors claim that PS exposure is not a dead end, as previously thought, and could be reversed. In addition, reduction of PS not only reduces apoptotic markers, but also greatly decreases the key necroptosis marker pMLKL.

#### Post
Why does always biology more complicated that we teach or thought? I for decade was sure that phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure by the cell, so called "eat me", is dead end. The last stage of apoptosis. New suggestion has been reveling to me by Wu and colleagues.  Eat me is wrather help me. Blocking this signal leads to inhibit apoptosis in stroke mice model. Moreover, for some reason it also decrease necroptosis level, which leads to more questions.
