Title: CASP8 may be inactive during ischemia
Tags: #reading_note #cell_death 


# Notes
 Our in vitro observations revealed that the apoptotic machinery in retinal cells is regulated, in part by a proteolytic cascade. Although all the stimuli studied, including simulated ischemia, excitotoxins, and hsp27 antibody, eventually caused the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, caspase-8 was cleaved only during apoptosis induced by hsp27 antibody. This observation suggests a different upstream signaling pathway for hsp27 antibody–mediated apoptosis, despite similar downstream effector events to those induced by other stimuli. 
# Summary
Due to I read a paper that suggests activity of caspase 8 in neurons during ischemia, it is possible that some cells do not initiate apoptosis or initiate it later.
