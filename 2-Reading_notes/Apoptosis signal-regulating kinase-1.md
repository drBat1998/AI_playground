Title: Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes
Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1), an MAPK kinase kinase (MKK), plays essential roles in stress-induced apoptosis (6, 7). ASK1 is activated in response to a variety of stress-related stimuli, including proinflammatory factors, reactive oxygen species, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and calcium influx, through distinct mechanisms, and it activates MKK4 and MKK3, which, in turn, activate JNK and p38 (6, 8–13). Previous studies have demonstrated that the ASK1/JNK/p38 pathway that is activated by stress-related stimuli was involved in neuronal apoptosis after SCI induced by I/R injury
# Summary
ASK1 is an MAPK kinase kinase (MKK) that activated in response to a variety of stress-related stimuli. ASK1/JNK/p38 pathway invovled in neuronal cell death during I/R injury.
