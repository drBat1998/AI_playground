# Notes
Morning Pages is a concept from the book The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron. The main idea is to set a specific time and write downstream of consciousness. From 1 to 3 pages long, you allow yourself to write anything that comes to your mind. The main takeaway is to create a habit of easy writing.
