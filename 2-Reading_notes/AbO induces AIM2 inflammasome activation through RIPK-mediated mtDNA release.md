Title: AbO induces AIM2 inflammasome activation through RIPK-mediated mtDNA release
Tags: #cell_death #reading_note 


# Notes
Our studies revealed a significant increase in the protein levels of RIPK1 and RIPK3 in mouse RPEs following Aβ1−40 treatment
# Summary
Huang et al. showed that Aβ1−40 treatment of retinal pigment epithelium initiates an inflammation response and cell death. The treatment initiates inflammasome activation between 12 hours to 4 days after treatment by the AIM2/caspase-1/IL-1β pathway. In addition, they detected elevation of the RIPK1/RIPK3 pathway; although necroptosis has not been excluded, the authors indicated that both RIPK1 and RIPK3 selective inhibitors reduce the AIM2 pathway. Since AIM2 is usually activated by dsDNA, the authors focused on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release, a significant source of cytoplasmic DNA. They also observe a decrease in mtDNA release in response to RIPK inhibition.
