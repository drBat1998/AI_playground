# Notes
PANoptosis, which was newly termed by the Kanneganti team in 2019, is a distinctly inflammatory PCD pathway that integrates pivotal components from other cell death pathways, including pyroptosis (P), apoptosis (A), and/or necroptosis (N), highlighting their crosstalk and coordination [[malireddiZBP1TAK1Master2019]]. 
# Summary
In 2019, Kanneganti et al. speculated that previously distinct death pathways, apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis, are coordinated and, in some sense, crosstalk.
