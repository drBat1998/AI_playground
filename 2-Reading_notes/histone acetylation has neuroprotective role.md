Title: histone acetylation has neuroprotective role
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes
Under pro-apoptotic conditions, restoring histone acetylation levels by overexpressing CBP or with HDAC inhibitors can significantly reduce neuronal loss invitro[38, 41].
# Summary
Increases histone acetylation by overexpression of HATs or HDAC inhibition may protect some neurons during some conditions.
