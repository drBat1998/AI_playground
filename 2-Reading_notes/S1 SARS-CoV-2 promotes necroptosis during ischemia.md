Title: S1 SARS-CoV-2 promotes necroptosis during ischemia
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes

# Summary
S1 spike glycoprotein subunits of SARS-CoV-2 can cross the blood-brain barrier and increase brain vulnerability to ischemia. Neuronal-like SH-SY5Y cells become more susceptible to ischemia, marked by activation of the necroptosis-related pathway through the overexpression of S1 spike subunits. vulnerability to ischemia.
