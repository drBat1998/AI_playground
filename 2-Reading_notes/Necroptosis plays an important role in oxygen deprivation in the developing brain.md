Title: Necroptosis plays an important role in oxygen deprivation in the developing brain
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes
Necroptosis has been evaluated by RIPK3_MLKL connection in cortical neurons of rats embryos. Reduction of MLKL activity reduces the sensitivity of these neurons to oxygen-glucose deprivation.
