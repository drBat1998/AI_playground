Title: DWI-FLAIR mismatch
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes
In ischemic stroke, the phenomenon with positive signals on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) but negative signals on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is defined as DWI-FLAIR mismatch, which indicates ischemia within 4.5 h (Thomalla et al., 2011).
# Summary
The DWI-FLAIR mismatch is an imaging concept in stroke neurology. It is now included in guidelines for selecting patients for reperfusion therapies in cases of unknown stroke onset.
DWI (Diffusion-Weighted Imaging) detects ischemic injury within minutes of onset and indicates acute ischemia. 
FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) becomes positive later, usually after 3–6 hours, as vasogenic edema and tissue water content increase.
