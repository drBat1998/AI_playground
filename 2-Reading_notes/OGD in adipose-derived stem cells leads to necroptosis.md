Title: OGD in adipose-derived stem cells leads to necroptosis

# Notes
Autologous fat transplantation is an aesthetic and reconstructive surgery technique, consists of the transfer of fat from one region to another. 
Unfortunately, the long-term survival rate of the graft differs. The central and intermediate zones of the graft usually undergo hypoxia and ischemia. New vessels derived from angiogenesis give sufficient supply to the fat only after 1-3 months. One way to improve the outcome of transplantation is to enrich adipose-derived stem cells from the patient's own body, a technique known as cell-assisted lipotransfer (CAL).  

ADSCs promote the survival of fat grafts through adipogenesis, angiogenesis, and the regulation of inflammation. Interestingly, the receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) inhibitor promotes ADSCs' function in several ways.
First, the disactivation of RIPK3 as a key regulator of necrosis leads to a reduction of necroptosis.  
Second, the RIPK3 inhibition leads to an increase in ADSCs differentiation via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)
