Summary – Zhang et al., 2023
This study investigated the effect of caspofungin, an antifungal drug, on ischemic brain injury and necroptosis. Using a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in PC12 cells, the authors found that ischemia reduced Pellino3 expression and RIPK1 ubiquitination, while increasing necroptosis-related proteins (RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL, and their phosphorylated forms).

Caspofungin administration after ischemia significantly improved neurological outcomes, reduced infarct volume, restored Pellino3 levels, enhanced RIPK1 ubiquitination, and suppressed necroptotic signaling. Similarly, in OGD-treated PC12 cells, Pellino3 overexpression reproduced these protective effects, reducing necroptosis and cellular injury.

The authors conclude that Pellino3 counteracts necroptosis by promoting RIPK1 ubiquitination, and that caspofungin exerts neuroprotection in ischemic stroke via upregulation of Pellino3, thereby inhibiting the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway.
