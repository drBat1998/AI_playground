Title: Propionate induce acidosis
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes
Shono, Y. et al. used propionate as a model of intracellular acidosis during brain ischemia. They showed that propionate in a concentration of 5 mM leads to an intracellular decrease in pH. For my research, this information revealed that the deteriorated effect of SCFAs may be due to their ability to induce acidosis.
