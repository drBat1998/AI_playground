# Notes
Cells of the Nervous System
1. Neurons
	- post-mitotic, so unreplaceble
	- highly metabolically active
	- cell body or perikaryon
	- neurites (dendrites and axons)
	- ‘Nissl substance’ (granular dark staining material rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum)
	- Neurons can be either 
		- multipolar (many dendrites, single axon. e.g. motor neurons), 
		- bipolar (single dendrite, single axon. e.g. sensory neurons in retina) 
		- or unipolar/pseudo-unipolar (single process which divides into central and peripheral axons, no dendrites. e.g. sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia)
	- The cell bodies of neurons make up the bulk of grey matter and deep nuclei of the brain and spinal cord. Their axons run as bundles within the white matter. 
	- Occasional neurons can be seen within the white matter, especially in the temporal lobe. This should not be mistaken for a neuronal migration abnormality
Box 1.1 How to Identify a Neuron
- Large cell and cell body
- Large nucleus
- Single prominent nucleolus
- Nissl substance (purplish granules on H&E)![[Screenshot 2025-07-11 at 16.46.03.png]]
2. Neural stem cells 
	- subventricular zone of lateral ventricles, i
	- n the dentate gyrus of hippocampus and 
	- in the olfactory bulb
3. Astrocytes
	- the most numerous of the glial cells 
	- give structural and metabolic support to a neuron. 
	- Astrocytes are derived from radial glial cells during embryonic development. 
	- Astrocytes appear to have several complex roles in healthy tissue, some of which include—development of grey and white matter, regulation of blood flow, maintaining biochemical homeostasis, synapse function, and CNS metabolism
	- The term ‘astrocyte’ means ‘star cell’ and refers to multiple radially arranged cytoplasmic processes which can be identified with a special stain such as phosphotungstic acid haematoxylin (PTAH). 
	- These processes abut on capillaries, neuron, axon, dendrites and pia mater (the innermost layer of meninges). The cytoplasmic processes contain characteristic filaments termed ‘glial fibrillary acidic protein’ or GFAP which can be demonstrated using immunohistochemistry.
	- Astrocytes can be of two morphological subtypes—
		- (1) fibrous or fibrillary astrocytes which have long processes rich in GFAP-positive filaments and are present in the white matter and, 
		- (2) protoplasmic astrocytes with short processes and few GFAP-positive filaments and mainly confined to the grey matter.
	- The cell processes of astrocytes form the background fibrillary meshwork called as ‘neuropil’ (seen as pink background on the standard H&E stain).

Box 1.2 How to Identify an Astrocyte
- Medium-size cell
- Round or oval nucleus with pale vesicular chromatin
- Indistinct nucleolus
- ‘Stellate’ cell processes (seen with special stains such as PTAH; appear as pink background on H&E stain)![[Screenshot 2025-07-11 at 17.15.04.png]]

4. Oligodendrocytes
	- Oligodendrocytes are the myelin producing cells within the CNS. 
	- Oligodendrocytes are presumed to be derived from a common progenitor cell which also gives rise to neurons and depend on various regulatory factors for their differentiation and migration. 
	- The process of myelination is complex and relies on neuronal and axonal signals [3]. 
	- Each oligodendrocyte forms myelin segments on multiple axons. 
	- They are mainly present within the white matter along bundles of axons which they myelinate. Within the grey matter they are often seen around the cell body of neurons as ‘satellite cells’ (Fig. 1.4a). ![[Screenshot 2025-07-11 at 17.15.19.png]]
	- Oligodendrocyte as the name implies, have fewer cytoplasmic processes compared to that of an astrocyte. These cell processes are not clearly visible on tissue sections. Therefore, these cells appear as naked dark round nuclei with perinuclear ‘halo’ or ‘fried egg’ appearance (Fig. 1.4b, Box 1.3). 
	- This cytoplasmic clearing is not evident in intraoperative frozen sections or tissue which is rapidly fixed in formalin and is considered an artefact of delayed fixation.
	- However, this is a very helpful feature in recognising a cell as being oligodendroglial in origin within a glial neoplasm.

Box 1.3 How to Identify an Oligodendrocyte
• Small to medium-size cell
• Dark round nucleus
• Cytoplasmic clearing or perinuclear ‘halo’ or ‘fried egg’ appearance

Schwann Cells
- Schwann cells perform the function of electrically insulating axons of the peripheral nervous system. 
- Unlike an oligodendrocyte, each Schwann cell myelinates only one axon. 
- The cell processes of a Schwann cell wrap around an axon in multiple layers forming the myelin sheath (Fig. 1.5a). 
- Large diameter axons are always myelinated whereas the small diameter axons can be myelinated or unmyelinated. 
- Myelinated nerve fibers conduct electrical signals faster than unmyelinated fibers. 
- Schwann cells also surround unmyelinated axons (Remak cell), with their cytoplasm wrapping around and isolating each axon from its neighbours (Fig. 1.5b). 
- A Schwann cell also performs an important role in nerve regeneration after injury

Ependyma
- The ependymal cells form the lining of the ventricular system (in the brain) and central canal (in the spinal cord). 
- They are believed to arise from ventricular (germinal) zone cells or radial glial cells. 
- The ependyma plays an important role during early stages of brain development and in mature brain by supporting and protecting the subventricular (germinal) zone cells and also possibly in the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the ventricular system [4]. 
- They are composed of a single layer of flattened or low cuboidal to columnar cells with apical cilia (Fig. 1.6). 
- They have round to oval dark basal nucleus (Box 1.4)

Box 1.4 How to Identify Ependyma
• A single layer of flattened or low cuboidal or columnar epithelium
• Uniform round to oval dark basal nucleus
• Apical cilia
• Moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm

Microglia 
- Microglia are the resident cells of the immune system within the CNS. 
- Therefore, in the strict sense they are not true glial cells but are derived from the bone marrow haematopoietic stem cells. 
- They are now believed to have important role in synapse function and maintenance in a normal brain [5, 6]. 
- They are small cells (in comparison to macroglia—astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependyma) with oval to elongated nuclei and contain numerous cytoplasmic processes. 
- They are generally inconspicuous in normal healthy brains on H&E stain, but on close scrutiny can be seen as elongated/oval ‘naked cigar-shaped immunohistochemistry’ (Fig. 1.7; Box 1.5). 
- They become more prominent in response to disease or injury. 
- They can also transform into macrophages and help clean up the cellular debris and microorganisms.

Box 1.5 How to Identify Microglia
-  Small cell
- Elongated or ‘cigar-shaped’ nucleus
- Numerous cytoplasmic processes (not visible on routine H&E stain; can be seen with specific immunostains such as HLA-DR and CD68)
