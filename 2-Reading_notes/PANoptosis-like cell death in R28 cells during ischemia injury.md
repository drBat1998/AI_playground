Title: PANoptosis-like cell death in R28 cells during ischemia injury
Tags: #cell_death #reading_note 


# Notes
Yan et al. showed that after oxygen-glucose deprivation in retinal precursor cells, pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis are induced more or less simultaneously. The authors demonstrated that key components of cell death pathways emerge following ischemic stress, and the use of a cell death inhibitor enhances cell survival rates.
However, is it enough to prove that PANoptosis exists in this condition?

First of all, the author does not show any specific receptors that initiate PANoptosis—ZBP1 or NLRP3 expression, for example, or how their inhibition influences the cell death pathways.

The possibility that all three cell death modes emerge independently, or even in separate cells, can also not be excluded.
