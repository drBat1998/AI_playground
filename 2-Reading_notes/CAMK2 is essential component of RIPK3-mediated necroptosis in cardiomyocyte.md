Title: CAMK2 is an essential component of RIPK3-mediated necroptosis in cardiomyocytes
Tags: #cell_death #reading_note 


# Notes
Zhang et al. state that CaMK2 is a RIPK3 substrate during both ischemic and oxidative stress-mediated necroptosis in cardiomyocytes. RIPK3 knock-out mice reduce ischemic/reperfusion-induced myocardial necrosis and cardiac remodeling. RIPK3 overexpression by an adenovirus vector is sufficient to induce necrosis in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, RIPK1 or MLKL silencing did not block RIP3-induced cardiomyocyte necroptosis, and even more, necrostatin-1, a RIPK1 inhibitor, also shows a moderate protective effect. 
RIPK3 interacts primarily with CaMK2 has been showed by co-immunoprecepitation.  Zhang et al. showed that CaMK2 inhibition reduces  I/R-induced myocardial infarction and necrosis.

The second notion is that ROS are involved in RIPK3-induced necroptosis. Nox2 knockdown shows RIPK3-induced necroptosis inhibition.
