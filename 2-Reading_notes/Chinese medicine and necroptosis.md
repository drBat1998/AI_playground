# Notes
Luteolin-7-O-β-D-glucuronide (LGU) is a major active flavonoid glycoside compound that is extracted from Ixeris sonchifolia (Bge.) Hance, and it is a Chinese medicinal herb mainly used for the treatment of coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, cerebral infarction, etc
Moreover, molecular docking analysis showed that LGU might bind to RIP3 more stably and firmly than the RIP3 inhibitor GSK872.
# Summary
Thousands of studies have been done over the past decades about different methods of traditional Chinese medicine. The promotion of this approach by China and moreover doesens well writen and well done papers in most prominent journal are interesting topics overall. Even necroptosis has been tested as a target of Luteolin-7-O-β-D-glucuronide (LGU) is a major active flavone glycoside compound extracted from Ixeris sonchifolia, a well-known folk medicine that is abundantly distributed throughout the northeastern part of China.

Fan et al. indicated that LGU, in the case of ischemia in rat cortical neurons, shows protective effect. LGU reduce LDH release and inhibits the expression of key necroptosis molecules such as MLKL, RIPK3, and RIPK1.
