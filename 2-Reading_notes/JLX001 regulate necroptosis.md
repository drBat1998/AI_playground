Title: JLX001 regulate necroptosis

# Notes
Boxwood is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that exerts the effects of dispelling rheumatism, regulating qi and relieving pain. Researchers have extracted the natural compound cyclovirobuxine D (CVB-D; molecular formula: C26H46N2O) from boxwood. Studies confirmed that CVB-D exerts a significant effect on many cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

On this basis, CVB-D bis-hydrochloride JLX001 (molecular formula: C26H46N2O·2HCl), which has a molecular weight of 475.6,  was artificially synthesized (the structure is shown in Fig. 1). The double hydrochloride structure gives CVB-D better solubility, which is conducive to drug absorption and delivery.

After the administration of JLX001, the relative expression of necroptosis-related molecules was measured by ELISA, RT-PCR, HE staining, immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The results showed that JLX001 significantly reduced pathological damage and the cerebral infarction rate in rat brain tissues, and the expression of neuronal necroptosis-related molecules was reduced, suggesting that JLX001 may regulate CIRI through the classic RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL necroptosis pathway. 
# Summary
Boxwood is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Researchers extracted cyclovirobuxine D from boxwood and confirmed that CVB-D exerts a significant effect on many cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. JLX001 was artificially synthesized with a double hydrochloride structure, resulting in better solubility than CVB-D.

Li et al. test JLX001 to regulate necroptosis in the context of ischemic reperfusion. he results showed that JLX001 significantly reduced pathological damage and the cerebral infarction rate in rat brain tissues, and the expression of neuronal necroptosis-related molecules was reduced.
