Title: SCFAs promote specific histone modification, unrelated to HDAC inhibition
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes

# Summary
The growing base of evidence suggests that SCFAs play multiple roles both in the gut and in the brain through the gut-brain axis by binding to receptors, feeding into energy pathways, and acting as inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes. New insights suggest that SCFAs have another posttranslational modification on histones, including butyrylation and propionylation on histone H3 lysine.

Gates's group provided ChIP-seq data of histone H3 lysines 9 and 27, butyrylation, and propionylation shifted gene expression of genes linked to mitochondrial function, oxidative phosphorylation, and autophagy. The findings highlight that histone modifications are dynamic epigenetic signals connecting microbial metabolites to host gene regulation.
