Title: SCFAs and inflammasome
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes
Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), like butyrate and propionate, produced by the gut microbiota during fiber fermentation, are generally seen as beneficial. However, they can have pro-inflammatory effects under inflammatory conditions, such as those seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Butyrate and propionate induce IL-1β release in human macrophages only in the presence of TLR agonists like lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This effect is dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome. SCFAs, as well-known HDAC inhibitors, suppress c-FLIP and XIAP, both negative regulators of caspase-8. Caspase-8 activity is essential in this circumstance to promote NLRP3 inflammasome induction.

What is peculiar to me is the interaction of this event with cell death. Despite IL-1β release and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, pyroptosis does not kill the macrophages, as determined by both the absence of potassium efflux and an intact cell membrane. Moreover, RIPK1 appears to inhibit this process.
