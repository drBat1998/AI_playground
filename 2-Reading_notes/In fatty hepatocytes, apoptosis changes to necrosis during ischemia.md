Title: In fatty hepatocytes, apoptosis changes to necrosis during ischemia
Tags: #reading_note #cell_death 


# Notes

# Summary
Ischemic reperfusion damage unleashes the apoptosis cascade in normal hepatocytes; on the contrary, hepatocytes during steatosis have a lower level of key apoptotic players and have more prominent necrosis. 
Selzner and colleagues, who provide the data, indicate that one of the key causes may be a low adenosine triphosphate production in fatty hepatocytes.
