Title: Complex I
Tags: #reading_note #inflammation 


# Notes
TNF, by interacting with TNF receptor 1, may recruit different complexes. Complex 1 consists with TNF-receptor-associated factor 2, RIPK1, cIAP1, cIAP2, and LUBAC( linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. cIAPs and LUBAC promote RIPK1 ubiquitination. This leads to creation of platform that promotes NF-kb and MAPK pathway activation. Disruption of complex I leads to forming complex II a or b. This complex includes Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) and caspase-8, with or without RIPK1. Complex 2 usually leads to apoptosis. But disruption of the balance between caspase 8 and RIPK3 leads complex 2 b to convert to necrosome.
# Summary
Complex I consists of TNF-receptor-associated factor 2, RIPK1, cIAP1, cIAP2, and LUBAC( linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex) and initiates before complex IIa or necrosome. Its activity leads to recruiting  NF-kb and MAPK pathways, so it promotes an inflammatory response.
