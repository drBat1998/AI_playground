Title: HDAC inhibits TNF-induced necroptosis
Tags: #reading_note #cell_death 


# Notes
In addition, when we pretreated L929 cells with 1–4 lM SAHA and then exposed them to 10 ng/mL TNFα for 24 h, we noted that instead of killing the cells, SAHA showed an obvious cell-protective effect, blocking TNF-induced necroptosis.
SAHA enhances TNFa-induced NFjB and p38 MAPK activation in murine fibrosarcoma L929 cells. The results showed that inactivation of NFjB or p38 MAPK both enhanced TNFa-induced necroptosis and completely eliminated the protective effect of SAHA
