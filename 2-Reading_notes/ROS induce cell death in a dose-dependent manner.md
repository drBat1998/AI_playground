Title: ROS induce cell death in a dose-dependent manner

Tags: #reading_note #cell_death 


# Notes
  ROS induces PREN-related PI3K/AKT downregulation and induces cell death. A small number of ROS leads to apoptosis, whereas a large amount leads to necroptosis.
# Summary
ROS may induce cell death in a dose-dependent manner—the higher the amount, the more probable necroptosis becomes. The author also suggests that the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway correlates with cell death induction. However, due to a lack of evidence, I cannot assume that the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway directly induces cell death or that it acts as a mediator between ROS and cell death.
