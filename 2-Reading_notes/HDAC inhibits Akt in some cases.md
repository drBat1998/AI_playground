However, instead of killing the cells, SAHA and rapamycin, a known autophagy initiator, induced autophagy, which could protect the cells from TNFa-induced necroptosis. However, the reported effects of autophagy on necroptosis are inconsistent even in the same cell type (L929 cells). One study reported that z-VAD could enhance necroptosis by initiating autophagy [64] and another suggested that the inhibition of autophagy could promote cell necrosis [33]. In contrast, other studies have reported that initiating autophagy could protect cells from necrosis [65, 66]. Our data indicate that SAHA protects L929 cells from TNFa-induced necroptosis by inhibiting Akt and its downstream mTOR activity and initiating autophagy.
# Summary
HDAC and the autophagy initiator could protect from TNF-induced necroptosis in some cases. But the protection effects are inconsistent even in the same cell line. Wang et al. data suggest that necroptosis decreases when Akt and mTOR are deactivated and autophagy is initiated.
