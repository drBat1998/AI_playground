Title: RIPK1 can induce parthanatos
Tags: #cell_death #reading_note 


# Notes
The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation leads to a unique form of cell death that is in large part mediated via receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1), caspase-independent, and termed parthanatos.
# Summary
The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) induces parthanatos through receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1).
