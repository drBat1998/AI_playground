Title: difference between necroptosis and necrosis in ROS, mitochondrial and lysosomal functions.
Tags: #cell_death #reading_note 


# Notes
On TNF stimulation, ROS generation gradually increased without major morphological changes (Figure 1a and b, between points t1 and t3, Supplementary video 1a), followed by an oxidative burst before PMP. In contrast, in H2O2induced necrosis, the onset of an oxidative burst occurred more rapidly (Figure 1c and d, Supplementary video 2a). In both conditions, the beginning of the ROS peak coincided with the initiation of typical necrotic features, such as rounding and swelling of cells (Figure 1a, Supplementary video 1b and Figure 1c, Supplementary video 2b). None of the above-mentioned observations were seen in unstimulated cells (Supplementary Figure 2a). Conclusively, TNF elicits a modest increase in ROS production during the signaling phase, which is followed by an oxidative burst coinciding with plasma membrane permeabilization

LMP has been reported as a crucial event during apoptosis and necrosis,14 we next analyzed lysosomal integrity using LysoTracker Red DND-99. During TNF-induced necroptosis, the onset of the typical oncosis morphology coincided with the start of LMP (Figure 3a and b, point t4, Supplementary video 5a and b), just after the onset of mitochondrial hyperpolarization (Figure 2a) and before oxidative burst (Figure 1a). In contrast, on addition of H2O2, lysosomes rapidly started to leak (Figure 3c and d, Supplementary video 6a and b), which persists longer than in TNF-induced

hese data demonstrate that lysosomal disruption is a late event in TNF-induced necroptosis and an early event in H2O2induced necrosis.

Note (Page 4)
In general necrosis, regulated or not, characterize by oxidative burst, mitochondrial hyperpolarization, and LMP.

Highlight (Page 8)
In conclusion, the cellular disintegration phase of the three types of necrosis (necroptosis, necrosis and secondary necrosis) is characterized by the same sequence of subcellular events, such as LMP, mitochondrial hyperpolarization, oxidative burst and eventually PMP. Moreover, the finding that LMP in apoptosis only occurs during the secondary necrosis phase may clarify the debate on the role and timing of LMP in apoptosis.
# Summary
In general necrosis, regulated or not, characterize by oxidative burst, mitochondrial transmembrane potential(MTP), lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and as a consequence plasma membrane permeabilization (PMP).

Although all of this characteristics have significant difference. 
ROS in context of necroptosis gradually increased without major morphological changes followed by an oxidative burst before plasma membrane permeabilization. On the contrary, necrosis-related oxidative burst occured more rapidly. 

MTP occure in both necroptosis and necrosis, but with different kinetics. Necrosis show imidate increase of MTP followed by rapidly returned to baseline. During necroptosis, on the other hand later biphasic hyperpolarization had been observed shortly before plasma membrane permeabilization.

Lysosomal membrane permebilization occure much more rapidly during necrosis than necroptosis. In necroptosis the LMP persists longer and occure later thatn in necrosis.
