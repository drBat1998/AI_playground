Tags: #reading_note #cell_death 


# Notes
 PANoptosome is mainly composed of three kinds of proteins: (1) sensor proteins such as Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1), which is also known as DNA-dependent activator of interferon regulatory factor (DAI), and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3); (2) adapter proteins with a caspase recruit domain, such as apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC); and (3) RIPK1, RIPK3, and caspase-1/8, which have catalytic effects [12]. 

# Summary
  PANoptosome consists of sensor, adapter, and catalytic proteins.
