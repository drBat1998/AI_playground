Title: RIPK3, necroptosis-unrelated function
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes
mtDNA-induced inflammation mediated by the TLR9 receptor, which induces inflammation by upregulation of RIPK3. Moreover, RIPK3 expression in the context of cardiomyocytes induces NF-kB and NLRP3, but for some reason does not lead to necroptosis.
