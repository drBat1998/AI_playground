Title: astrocytes share functional mitochondria with neurons during stroke model
Tags: #reading_note 


### Notes
Astrocytes rescue neuron after ischemic like condition, buy sharing functional mitochondria.
Ischemic condition reduce energy level in neurons and its volubility that leads to neurons death. Astrocyte-conditioned media rescue neurons from the condition, while extracellular mitochondria were removed from the media, neuroprotection was no longer observed. Hayakawa and colleagues indicated that the sharing of mitochondria occurs via CD38-mediated mechanisms. I wounder does damaged mitochondria also chared?

### Post
Death of neurons occurs rapidly and on more extensive area than stroke original occure.  However, some neurons may be rescue. One of this mechanism is by mitochondria charing. Mitochondria is biggest supplier of energy, so neaded neurons to survive. Hayakawa and colleagues discover that astrocytes, the supporter of neurons, can share some mitochondria.
