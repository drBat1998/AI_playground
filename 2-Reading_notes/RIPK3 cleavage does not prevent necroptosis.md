Title: RIPK3 cleavage does not prevent necroptosis
Tags: #reading_note #cell_death 


# Notes
The proximity of caspase-8, RIPK1 and RIPK3 within complex II/ RIPoptosome, as well as the rescue of Casp8-deficient and catalytically inactive mice by loss of Ripk3 or Mlkl supports the notion that caspase-8 cleaves RIPK3 to prevent necroptosis. However, unlike the non-cleavable RIPK1 mice, our findings reveal that the genetic blockade of RIPK3 cleavage at D333 does not lead to uncontrolled lethal necroptosis. These results suggest the existence of other molecular mechanisms that may substitute or cooperate with RIPK3 cleavage in suppressing necroptosis.
# Summary
RIPK3 has been described as an essential component for necroptosis activation. Cleavage of RIPK3 by CASP8 has been suggested as a crucial checkpoint between apoptosis and necroptosis. CASP8 genetic disactivation leads to midgestational lethality or death at birth in mice, and only inhibition of MLKL, the executor molecule in necroptosis, rescues the mice. However, Najoua Lalaoui et al. challenge that by an extremely beautiful experiment by design. They disrupt not CASP8 in its ability to cleave, but RIPK3 in its ability to be cleaved. The experiment leads to unexpected results: necroptosis wasn’t compromised in the slightest; on the contrary, pyroptosis mechanisms were reduced. So, these findings only strengthen my thoughts about how little we know about cell death.
