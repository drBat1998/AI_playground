Title: ZBP1 and ROS
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes
Our study reveals that ROS generated during liver I/R facilitates ZBP1 aggregation and activation, presumably due to ROS-mediated disulfide bond formation, which has been observed in a previous study ([[zhangRIP1AutophosphorylationPromoted2017]]). This finding may have a significant impact on the understanding of activation mechanism of ZBP1, which might be implicated in other human diseases since ROS is frequently activated in many pathologic conditions.
# Summary
So, ROS may induce cell death by mediating disulfide bond formation between ZBP1.
