# Notes

# Summary
PARP1 is a polymerase that transfers the ADP-ribose group to acceptor proteins. It uses energy from NAD+ to do so. In physiological conditions, PARP1 is a significant player in the DNA damage repair system. Overactivation of PARP1 during vast DNA damage leads to cell death called parthanatos.
