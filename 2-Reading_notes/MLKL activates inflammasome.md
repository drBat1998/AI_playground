Title: MLKL activates inflammasome
Tags: #cell_death #reading_note 


# Notes
Gutierrez et al are not the first that suggest that MLKL induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL1b release, but they first that prove it. It was a great challenge to do so, due to the requirement for caspase inhibition for necroptosis, which in turn prevents caspase 1 activity, essential for IL1b bioactivity, alongside caspase 8.  To prove this notion, they create a cell line with MLKL that is ligand-activatable without compromising caspase. In addition, they knock out RIPK3 in cell lines, due to some researchers have shown its capability to induce IL1b cleavage in some circumstances. Importantly, both RIPK3-deficient and caspase-1-deficient cells underwent loss of membrane integrity and cell death with equivalent kinetics upon direct activation of ligand-induced MLKL, so the ligand-induced MLKL construct allows induction of cell death independent of the canonical pyroptotic or necroptotic pathways.

Further, they provide evidence that MLKL-induced membrane disruption promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation via potassium efflux. Notably, this effect is independent of GSDMD, which is required for efficient release of IL-1β during caspase-dependent pyroptosis.
