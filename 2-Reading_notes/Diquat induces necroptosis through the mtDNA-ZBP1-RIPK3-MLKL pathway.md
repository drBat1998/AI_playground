# Notes
Diquat (DQ) is a potent, broad-spectrum herbicide known for its capacity to induce severe and potentially lethal damage across multiple organ systems 
Strikingly, it is noteworthy that ROS exerts influence over mtDNA stability because mtDNA lacking free DNA ends experiences reduced torsional strain during replication and transcription, which potentially promotes a transition from B- to Z-DNA structures [7, 10]. This transition is driven by diminished activities of mitochondrial DNA topoisomerases, particularly DNA topoisomerase I mitochondrial (TOP1MT) and DNA topoisomerase III alpha (TOP3A) [11]. Recent research highlights the pivotal role of Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) as a receptor for nuclear Z-DNA [12], double-stranded Z-RNA [13–15], and Z-mtDNA [16, 17].

DQ can initiate both necroptotic and ferroptotic pathways, contingent upon the presence of mitochondrial ROS and the formation of Z-mtDNA. We observed that ZBP1 is activated in response to Z-mtDNA, subsequently instigating RIPK3-dependent necroptotic and ferroptotic signaling cascades. Notably, RIPK3 assumes a dual role, phosphorylating MLKL to induce necroptosis and phosphorylating FSP1 to inhibit its enzymatic activity to trigger ferroptosis.
# Summary
Diquat (DQ) is a broad-spectrum herbicide that can induce severe damage across multiple organ systems, despite the mechanism of damage remaining been enigma for a while. Lai et al. indicated the possibility that DQ induces necroptosis and ferroptosis. They showed severe mitochondrial dysfunction and Z-mtDNA formation by DQ treatment. DQ induces mtDNA flux from mitochondria and changes the conformation to Z-form, which can be detected by ZBP1 receptor. Deletion by ZBP1 or RIPK3 ameliorates damage mediated by Diquat. Moreover, even disability key region of the ZBP1 receptor has been sufficient to inhibit DQ-induced necroptosis. In addition, they provide evidence that RIPK3 promotes ferroptosis through FSP1 inhibition.
