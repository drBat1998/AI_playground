Title: neonatal propionic acidemia
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes
In neonatal Propionic Acidemia (PA), Propionyl CoA Carboxylase (PCC), involved in the metabolism of amino and fatty acids, is not functional due to a mutation in one of the two genes that code for its Alpha and Beta subunits; PCCA and PCCB. As a result, PPA accumulates in the blood causing severe seizures, movement disorders, gastrointestinal issues, aloofness, and overall developmental delays13 
# Summary
Deficiency in Propionyl CoA Carboxylase due to genetic mutation leads to accumulation of propionic acids and, as a consequence, neonatal propionic acidemia. Propionic acidemia manifests by severe seizures, movement disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and developmental delay.
