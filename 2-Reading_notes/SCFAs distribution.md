Title: SCFAs distribution

# Notes

# Summary
Short-chain fatty acids (SFCAs) are a group of small fatty acids that have a significant impact on the brain.  While some SFCAs come from food, the primary source is from microbial fermentation. This notion supports a remarkable decrease in their level in germ-free animals or after antibiotic treatment. Although SCFAs can be absorbed directly by diffusion, major SCFAs are absorbed by facilitated diffusion as salts by sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter (SMCT1) and pH-dependent hydrogen-coupled monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and 4. After that their moved through the blood to the liver, where they are partially metabolized, so only a portion of them may further reach the brain. Mean concentrations in the bloodwere 70 μmol/l for acetate, 5 μmol/l for propionate, and 4 μmol/l for butyrate. In addition, they have another obstacle before influencing the brain, the blood-brain barrier, which they can pass through. The Human Metabolome Database reports cerebrospinal fluid SCFA concentrations as 0–171 μM for acetate, 0–5 μM for propionate, and 0–2.8 μM for butyrate. As a consequence, they was ditected in the human brain as 17.0 pmol/mg of tissue for butyrate and 18.8 pmol/mg of tissue for propionate.
