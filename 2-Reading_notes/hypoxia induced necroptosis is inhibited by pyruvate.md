Title: hypoxia induced necroptosis is inhibited by pyruvate
Tags: #cell_death #reading_note 


# Notes
Hypoxia induced necroptosis ameliorate in colonic cancer cells thorugh intake of pyruvate. Interestingly it was not coupled with restorin neighter ATP or mitochondrial potential, the author claimed that mitochondrial ROS inhibition play more significant role. 
# Summary
Pyruvate could inhibit necroptosis without restoring cell energy level.
