Title: phosphatidylserine in apoptosis
Tags: #cell_death #reading_note 


# Notes
In mammals, exposition of phosphatidylserine serves as bait for macrophages that then deal with the disposal of the  apoptotic bodies (Fadok et al., 1992; Martin et al., 1995). Our observation in yeast indicates a more fundamental connection between phosphatidylserine exposure and other events of apoptosis. Therefore, the exposure probably has not been developed to attract macrophages, but rather phagocytic cells throughout evolution have learned to interpret the phenomenon as a signal of attraction. 
# Summary
Phosphatidylserine play a significant role in ditection of apoptotic bodies during the end stage of apoptosis. It is a marker for macrophage that sign that the bodies mast be removed. The madeo et al showed that phosphatidylserine use to have some other function and macrophage evolved to detect it and not wise versa.
