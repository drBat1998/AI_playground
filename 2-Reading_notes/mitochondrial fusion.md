# Notes

# Summary
Mitochondria undergo constant changes due to physiological or pathological stimuli. 
Mitochondrial fusion has a protective role. 
Mitochondria dynamically fused and divided to save as many functional organelles as possible. If one mitochondrion is mildly damaged, fusion with a healthy one could maintain its functionality.
