Title: HATs and HDACs regulate the acetylation of non-histone proteins
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes
HATs and HDACs can also regulate the acetylation of non-histone proteins, including α-tubulin, molecular chaperone heat shock protein (HSP) 90, and transcription factors p53, E2F1, nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB), Smad7, and STAT-3 
# Summary
Acetylation also can occure in other molecules including α-tubulin, molecular chaperone heat shock protein (HSP) 90, and transcription factors p53, E2F1, nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB), Smad7, and STAT-3.
