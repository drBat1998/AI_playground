# Summary
Marvelous programmed cell death occurs in bacteria. First discovered in E. coli, the system consists of two main players, the toxin and the antitoxin. The antitoxin constantly interacts with the toxin, suppressing the death sentence for the cell initiated by the toxin. Some of these systems, like mazEF, are stress-induced. Multiple factors, from extreme amino acid starvation to DNA damage, can decrease the mazE (antitoxin) level and lead to uninterrupted suicide, controlled by mazF (toxin). Some antitoxins exist inside plasmids, so a low number of them could abolish the bacteria as well.
