Title: Necroptosis occurs mainly in T2(+) region and does not occur in DWI-FLAIR mismatch
Tags: #cell_death #reading_note 


# Notes
The neuronal densities did not change in the T2(+) and mismatch regions compared with those in the control region, but the NeuN intensity in some neurons decreased in the T2(+) region (Figures 2A,B). We then investigated whether apoptosis and necroptosis were involved in these regions by examining the expression of active caspase 3 and phosphorylated receptor-interacting protein 3 (pRIP3), respectively. The densities of active caspase 3(+) cells indicating apoptosis in the mismatch and T2(+) areas were significantly higher than those in the control area (Figures 2C,D). The pRIP3(+) area proportion the area of pRIP3(+) divided by the total analyzed area) was larger in the T2(+) region than in the control region (Figures 2E,F). The mismach earia lower with necroptosis, but sufficient level of apoptosis.
# Summary
Necroptosis primarily occurs in the T2+ region and exhibits limited expression in the DWI-FLAIR mismatch region. On the contrary, apoptosis increases in both regions.
