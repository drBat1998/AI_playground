Title: Ab in SH-SY5Y cells induce necroptosis
Tags: #reading_note #necroptosis 


# Notes

# Summary
Chan et al. showed that Aβ-induced neuronal cell death in SH-SY5Y cells was independent of apoptosis pathway, co-treatment of caspase inhibitor (Z-Vad) with Ab does not gice significant improvement in the cell viability. Further investigation showed that Ab increase key necroptosis markeres, such as RIPK3 and MLKL. In addition, APP-overexpressed cells showed similar level of the markers expression during Ab treatmenr.  Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of RIPK1 and MLKL increase the viability of Aβ-treated SH-SY5Y cells.
