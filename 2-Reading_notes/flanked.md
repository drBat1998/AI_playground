# Notes
<b>Flanked</b> means <b>surrounded or bordered on both sides</b> by something. In the context of <b>floxed mice</b>, a gene is <b>flanked</b> by <b>loxP sites</b>—meaning that two loxP sequences are positioned <b>on either side</b> of the target gene. This allows the <b>Cre recombinase</b> enzyme to recognize and modify the DNA sequence between them.**
# Summary
