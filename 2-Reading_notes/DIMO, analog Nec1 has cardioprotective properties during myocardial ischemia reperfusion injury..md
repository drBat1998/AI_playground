Highlight (Page 11)
In this study, we have demonstrated that Nec-1 analog DIMO administered at the onset of reperfusion contributed to cardioprotective effect against myocardial I/R injury. DIMO inhibited RIP1K expression, restored myocardial I/R-impaired autophagic flux and decreased active-cathepsin B and L expression in rats, which is likely the underlying mechanism of cardioprotection conferred by DIMO.


“However, the short half-life of Nec-1 severely affected the efficacy of its drug treatment. Therefore, a structural analog of Nec-1 (Z)-5-(3,5dimethoxybenzylidene)-2-imino-1-methyl imidazolidin-4-1 (DIMO) was synthesized in our laboratory to elucidate its effect and mechanism on myocardial I/R injury.” ([Qiao et al., 2021, p. 190](zotero://select/library/items/ALEULP5U)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TDX7FAZS?page=2&annotation=CR3Y4PXW))
# Summary
Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) has become a potential therapeutic agent for myocardial, renal, and cerebral I/R injury. It has a major disadvantage: a short half-life, so Qiao et al. proposed a structural analog of Nec-1 (Z)-5-(3,5dimethoxybenzylidene)-2-imino-1-methyl imidazolidin-4-1 (DIMO). DIMO inhibited RIP1K expression and restored I/R-impaired autophagic flux.
