# Notes
Inulin is dietary fiber that can not be absorbed by the human intestinum, and only digest by gut microbioma into SCFAs.
# Summary
Inulin as dietary fiber that specifically change and absorbe into organism as SCFAs, provide interesting opportunity to use it as a some sort of model. We can't use it for now due to lack of ability to detect SCFAs in our lab.
