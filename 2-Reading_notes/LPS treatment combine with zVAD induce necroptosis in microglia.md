Title: LPS treatment combine with zVAD induce necroptosis in microglia
Tags: #reading_note #cell_death 


# Notes
Kim and Li (2013) investigated how microglial survival and death are regulated when apoptosis is inhibited. They showed that Toll-like receptor (TLR)-activated microglia undergo RIP1/RIP3-dependent necroptosis when exposed to caspase inhibitors such as zVAD-fmk or IETD-fmk. While these inhibitors alone had no effect on unstimulated microglia, they strongly sensitized microglia to TLR1/2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7/8 ligands, or TNF, triggering necroptotic death. This process was completely prevented by necrostatin-1, a RIP1 kinase inhibitor.

A key finding is that necroptosis occurred selectively in microglia and was absent in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes despite their TLR expression. The authors also discovered that TLR3/4-induced necroptosis was independent of TNF/TNFR1 signaling but required TRIF and RIP3, placing TRIF upstream in the necroptosis pathway. Furthermore, the death process relied on JNK activation and specific reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

The study highlights the dual role of microglia: while essential for CNS defense, their dysregulated elimination through necroptosis may worsen neuroinflammation and pathology. The protective effects of necrostatin-1 in ischemia and hypoxic-ischemic injury models further suggest therapeutic relevance.

Key Points
Trigger: Caspase inhibition (zVAD/IETD) + TLR stimulation.
Mechanism: RIP1/RIP3-dependent necroptosis; TRIF-dependent for TLR3/4.
Cell specificity: Occurs in microglia, not neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes.
Execution: Requires JNK activation and ROS generation.
Therapeutic link: Necrostatin-1 abolishes necroptosis and has shown neuroprotective effects in ischemic models.
Implication: Microglial necroptosis represents a TNF-independent programmed death pathway that may contribute to chronic CNS disease when uncontrolled.
# Summary
Necroptosis plays a backup role in the context of regulatory cell death. Inactivation of caspase-8 activity leads to execution by regulated necrosis in different contexts.

Evidence provided by Kim and Li indicates activation of necroptosis in response to LPS if caspase has been inactivated. Interestingly, only microglia die by necroptosis when LPS and zVAD are combined. Deletion of genes encoding TNF or TNFR1 failed to prevent lipopolysaccharide- and poly(I:C)-induced microglial necroptosis.
