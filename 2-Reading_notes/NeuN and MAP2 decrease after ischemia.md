Title: NeuN and MAP2 decrease after ischemia

Highlight (Page 2)
Neurons are extremely sensitive to ischemia, and the expression patterns of several molecules are altered in ischemic neurons. Structural proteins such as microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) have reduced immunoreactivity within 12 and 24 h, respectively, after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (Buscemi et al., 2019).

The neuronal densities did not change in the T2(+) and mismatch regions compared with those in the control region, but the NeuN intensity in some neurons decreased in the T2(+) region (Figures 2A,B).

The Cellular Pathology in the Mismatch and T2(+) Regions Given the lack of information on the pathological and molecular expression patterns in the mismatch regions after ischemic stroke, we first demonstrated that the cell and NeuN(+) neuronal densities did not change significantly in the T2(+) and mismatch areas. NeuN is a specific neuronal marker expressed in most types of neurons in the central nervous system (Gusel’nikova and Korzhevskiy, 2015). Some neurons, especially the damaged ones, might lose NeuN immunoreactivity due to decreased synthesis or changed immunoreactivity of NeuN, which may underestimate neuron density (Unal-Cevik et al., 2004). We showed that some neurons had a faint NeuN staining in the T2(+) region, indicating the transition to the absence of NeuN immunoreactivity. In addition to brain ischemia, various brain pathologies such as irradiation injury, poison toxicity, and viral infection also reduce NeuN immunoreactivity in neurons (Collombet et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2010; Hahn et al., 2015). Altogether, this study provides evidence of changes in the pathology of ischemic neurons with a short ischemic duration.
# Summary

NeuN and MAP2 may decrease in level of expression after 12 and 24 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion; also, it is not lost completely, which may add to the disturbance in data.
