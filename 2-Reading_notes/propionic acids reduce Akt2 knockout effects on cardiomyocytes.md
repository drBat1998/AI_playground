Title: Propionic acids reduce Akt2 knockout effects on cardiomyocytes
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes
Akt2 knockout cardiomyocytes showed a decrease in mechanical function compared to control. In contrast to WT, propionate improves mechanical function of cardiomyocytes in Akt2 knockout mice.
# Summary
propionic acids improve the function of cardiomyocytes during Akt2 deficiency
