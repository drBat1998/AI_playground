Title: OTUB2 promotes necroptosis in ischemic stroke model
Tags: #cell_death #reading_note 


# Notes
OTUB2 increases neuronal loss and neuroinflammation after ischemic stroke. OTUB2 potentiates neuronal necroptosis after ischemia. OTUB2 inhibits the proteasomal degradation of RIPK3 via K48 deubiquitination. Pharmacological inhibition of OTUB2 ameliorates ischemic stroke injury
# Summary
Ubiquitin-related degradation modulates the majority of pathways in physiological and pathological conditions, so it is not suspicions that ubiquitin-proteosome degradation regulates cell death in ischemic conditions. 

Multiple E3 ligases, including but not limited to PELI1, TRIM11, TRIM25, and CHIP, can ubiquitinate RIPK3 for degradation in the proteasome. Logically, ubiquitination of RIPK3 reduces the necroptosis level, so that deubiquitination promotes cell death.

Mei et al. found that the DUB OTUB2 enhanced cerebral ischemic injury by increasing RIPK3-mediated neuronal Ubiquitin-related degradation modulates most pathways in both physiological and pathological conditions, so it is not surprising that ubiquitin-proteasome degradation regulates cell death during ischemic conditions. Multiple E3 ligases, including but not limited to PELI1, TRIM11, TRIM25, and CHIP, can ubiquitinate RIPK3 for degradation via the proteasome. Logically, ubiquitination of RIPK3 decreases necroptosis levels, so deubiquitination promotes cell death. 

Mei et al. found that the deubiquitinating enzyme OTUB2 increased cerebral ischemic injury by enhancing RIPK3-mediated neuronal necroptosis. Additionally, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of OTUB2 alleviates ischemic stroke injury. necroptosis. In addition, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of OTUB2 ameliorates ischemic stroke injury.
