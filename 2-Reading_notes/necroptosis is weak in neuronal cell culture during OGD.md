Title: necroptosis is weak in neuronal cell culture during OGD

# Notes

Necroptosis may play a more prominent role in mixed culture and whole animal models than in neuronal culture during oxygen/glucose deprivation.
Meloni et al. showed that necrostatin decreases cell death during OGD/R, but slightly due to neuronal culture limitations. It is a distinct possibility that in mixed culture, astrocytes and microglia produce a larger amount of TNFα or other substances that could promote necroptosis and extrinsic apoptosis in neurons.
