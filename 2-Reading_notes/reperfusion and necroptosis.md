Title: reperfusion and necroptosis
Tags: #reading_note #cell_death 


# Notes
Reperfusion after ischemic occlusion is essential for the activation of necroptosis, as p-MLKL was not detected in the ischemic brains without reperfusion (a permanent occlusion stroke model) (Fig. 2 B and C).
# Summary
Without reperfusion necroptosis does not occure in ischemic brain.
