Title: mPTP and necroptosis
Tags: #cell_death #reading_note 


# Notes
ANT and CYPD are components of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) that regulates the exchange of ADP and ATP between the cytosol and the mitochondria (reviewed in [64]). During programmed necrosis, this ADP-ATP exchange function of the mPTP is compromised [59]. Consistent with this observation, Cypd−/− cells are partially resistant to TNF-, IAP antagonist-, and zVAD-fmk induced programmed necrosis [28]. Thus, the cellular metabolic “fitness level” might greatly influence the outcome of pro-necrotic cell signaling, a notion that seems to be supported by the correlation between reduced cellular ATP level and increased susceptibility to necrotic cell injury in older individuals [57]. These recent findings suggest that different effector mechanisms operate in different cell types to mediate programmed necrosis
# Summary
Cyclophilin D (CypD) is a protein found in mitochondria that plays a key role in regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a large pore located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. When it opens, it can cause the mitochondria to swell, leading to a loss of membrane potential and decreased ATP production. Cypd−/− cells are partially resistant to TNF-, IAP antagonist-, and zVAD-fmk induced programmed necrosis. Also the data suggests a posible important function of Cypd during necroptosis. NCCD 2018 recommendations state that Cyclophilin D (CypD) is the signature regulator of mitochondrial-permeability-transition-(MPT)-driven regulated necrosis, not of canonical MLKL/RIPK3-dependent necroptosis. However, RIPK3 can activate CaMKII, and CaMKII can open the mPT pore, so necroptosis signalling may secondarily recruit CypD—but that is a downstream amplification loop, not part of the core necroptosis machinery. #mini_essay
