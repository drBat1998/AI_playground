Title: ZBP1 induces PANoptosis-like cell death in cardiomyocytes during ischemia
Tags: #reading_note #cell_death 


# Notes

# Summary
Ischemia induces PANoptosis-like cell death in cardiomyocytes via ZBP1 receptor. Interesting that the authors claim that the PANoptosis is cardiomyocyte-specific and does not include several canonical PANoptosis components, such as RIPK1, NLRP3, and ASC.
