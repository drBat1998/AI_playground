Title: Atg7 deficiency prevents neuron cell death during ischemia
Tags: #reading_note #cell_death 


# Notes
H/I injury induced autophagy in neonatal hippocampal pyramidal neurons, whereas this pyramidal neuron death was prevented by Atg7 deficiency.
# Summary
Inhibition of autophagy during ischemia leads to a decrease in pyramidal neuron death.
