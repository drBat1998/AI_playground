Title: TAMs and necroptosis
Tags: #reading_note #cell_death 


# Notes
TYRO3, AXL, and MER receptor kinases (TAMs) were identified as MLKL kinases84. TAMs phosphorylate Tyr376 of MLKL.
 Loss of TAMs attenuated necroptosis without changing the phosphorylation of RIPK1, RIPK3, or Ser358 in MLKL
# Summary
TYRO3, AXL, and MER receptor kinases play a more important role than RIPK3 activity of MLKL and may be essential part of necroptosis.
