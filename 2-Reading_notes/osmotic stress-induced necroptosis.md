Title: osmotic stress-induced necroptosis
Tags: #reading_note #cell_death 


# Notes
Using a genome-wide CRISPRCas9 screen, the researchers identified Slc9a1, which encodes Na+/H+ exchanger-1 (NHE1), as the only gene involved in osmotic stress-induced necroptosis that does not belong to the canonical necroptosis pathway.

n cells cultured with high concentrations of NaCl or sucrose to increase osmolality, NHE1 increased cytosolic pH and promoted RIPK3 autophosphorylation and necroptosis, whereas pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 prevented osmotic stress-induced necroptosis.

increased intracellular pH was sufficient to activate RIPK3. These findings identify a non-canonical pathway for RIPK3 activation and further increase the complexity of mechanisms known to drive necroptosis.

However, deletion of the RHIM domain of RIPK3 did not affect osmotic stress-induced MLKL phosphorylation and necroptosis. By contrast, deletion of 10 amino acids in the kinase domain of RIPK3 prevented MLKL phosphorylation in response to osmotic stress, identifying the kinase domain as essential for osmotic stress-induced necroptosis.

In human induced pluripotent stem cells, overexpression of NHE1 and consequent cytosolic alkalization induced necrotic cell death through sustained activation of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), although the targets of ROCK were not identified3.
# Summary
RIPK3 is a key player in regulated necrosis. Usually, RIPK3 is activated by receptor-interacting protein homotypic interaction motif (RHIM)-containing proteins, including RIPK1, TRIF, and ZBP1. Zhang et al. proposed an alternative mechanism of RIPK3 activation during osmotic stress. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, the researchers identified the Na+/H+ exchanger-1 (NHE1) as the only gene involved in osmotic stress-induced necroptosis that does not belong to the canonical necroptosis pathway. NHE1 increased cytosolic pH in response to osmotic changes, and the researchers found that increased intracellular pH was sufficient to activate RIPK3. Moreover, deletion of the RHIM domain of RIPK3 did not affect osmotic stress-induced MLKL phosphorylation and necroptosis, in contrast to deletion of the kinase domain of RIPK3, which prevented necroptosis in response to osmotic stress. I think it is an enormous breakthrough that promotes further research into the non-canonical activation of RIPK3-mediated necroptosis.
