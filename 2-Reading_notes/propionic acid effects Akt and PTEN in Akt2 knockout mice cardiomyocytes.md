Title: propionic acid effects Akt and PTEN in Akt2 knockout mice cardiomyocytes
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes
Propionate beneficial effects are not associated with Akt or PTEN. Propionate decreases Akt activity by reducing p-Akt and does not have any significant effect on the function of PTEN in cardiomyocytes. 
# Summary
Propionic acids reduce activity of Akt in WT mice cardiomyocytes, and elevated a bit in case of Akt2 knockout. In cardiomyocytes, propionic acid does not have any significant effects on PTEN.
