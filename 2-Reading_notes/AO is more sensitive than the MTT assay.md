Title: AO is more sensitive than the MTT assay
Tags: #reading_note 


# Notes
Concentrations detectable by LCP were up to 40 times lower than the IC10 value, based on values previously determined with MTT (i.e., the inhibitory concentration of 10% of the population), indicating a greater sensitivity.
