Title: zVAD and OGD
Tags: #cell_death #reading_note 


# Notes
Chen et al[^1] showed that RIPK1 and the necroptosis phenotype are caused by the combined effect of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and zVAD (caspase inhibitor). Even more peculiar, treatment with oxygen-glucose deprivation alone showed greater LDH leakage than the combined OGD/zVAD treatment. These data are consistent with those provided by Feng and colleagues[^2]. Moreover, the expression of key molecules such as RIPK3, RIPK1, and both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated MLKL shows no significant difference between OGD and zVAD, and may be even more prominent in OGD[^3].
