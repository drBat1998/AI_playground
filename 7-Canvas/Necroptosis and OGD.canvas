In order to understand the role of MLKL in mitochondria, Wan and colleagues performed a set of experiments. They showed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting (WB) that MLKL directly interacts with VDAC1. Moreover, genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting MLKL or VDAC1 leads to decreased levels of ROS and Ca²⁺, and overall necroptosis suppression. VDAC1 is known to upregulate mitochondrial permeability, which leads to the leakage of cytochrome c, mtDNA, intracellular Ca²⁺, and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the authors speculated that MLKL promotes VDAC1 oligomerization. In addition to necroptosis, this pathway may also lead to intrinsic apoptosis, indicating a connection between different cell-death pathways and promoting the concept of PANoptosis. [^47][^48]\n\nCAMK2 \nExecution of the cell via necroptosis is not limited to MLKL-related permeabilization of the membrane. Regulated necrosis has another important substrate: calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CAMK2D). CaMKII is a serine-threonine kinase involved in calcium regulation. It is a well-validated nodal signal that promotes cardiomyocyte death through several pathways and can execute cell death independently of MLKL[^13]. Wang et al. showed that during brain ischemia in a mouse model, both in vitro and in vivo, MLKL activity is induced alongside CaMKII activity. RIPK3 induces CaMKII activity in both cardiomyocytes[^46] and cortical neurons[^32]. CaMKII promotes the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), so an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration leads to calcium overload. These findings demonstrate that RIPK3 is central to the necroptosis process and can activate necroptosis through multiple pathways[^32]. What is even more peculiar is that Zhang et al in cardiomyocytes indicate that RIPK1 and MLKL are not essential parts of necroptosis, in contrast to CaMKII and RIPK3[^46].\n\nHeat shock protein 90α (HSP90α) is a molecular chaperone and plays a crucial role in protein folding, stabilization, and trafficking under both normal and stress conditions. Wang et al. showed that HSP90 could directly bind to RIPK3 and RIPK1 and promote their stability. Moreover, both pharmacological (geldanamycin) and genetic inhibition of HSP90α lead to decreased necroptosis and reduced expression of both active and inactive forms of RIP3 and MLKL, and reduced necrosome assembly (RIP1–RIP3 complex formation) in cortical neurons, HT-29, and PC-12 cell lines. [^21]\n\n[[ROS and necroptosis]]\nReactive oxygen species are correlated with necroptosis in various contexts, ranging from cancer to ischemia. Several studies suggest that RIPK1 promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation via NOX1 and RAC1; RIPK3, on the other hand, elevates ROS through GLUD1. Moreover, Nec-1 could decrease ROS production. Interestingly, ROS promotes RIPK1 autophosphorylation, as demonstrated by Zang et al. ROS targets cysteine S161, enhances and facilitates necrosome formation, and, as a consequence, further maintains necroptosis. What's even more fascinating: butylated hydroxyanisole–mediated decrease of reactive oxygen species does not significantly affect necroptosis initiation.[^49][^50] So, these data suggest that ROS plays a significant role in necroptosis as part of the positive loop. \n\n\n\n==Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of over 100 genes involved in the cellular response to ischemic brain injury, including those linked to oxidative stress and cell death. Strangely, a connection between necrotptosis and HIF1a has not been studied explicitly. Yang et al. demonstrated that inhibition of necroptosis—either by pharmacological blockade using GSK’872 or by RIPK3 knockdown with siRNA—reduces both necroptosis signaling and HIF-1α expression in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic stroke[^18]. However, direct inhibition of HIF-1α did not significantly alter necroptosis markers, suggesting that HIF-1α may act as a downstream effector rather than a primary initiator of necroptotic signaling. Interestingly, under hypoxic conditions, both HIF-1α and BNIP3 are significantly upregulated and have been shown to promote necroptosis. Additionally, p53 activation can shift the balance from BNIP3-mediated necroptosis to apoptosis by disrupting cellular acidosis and suppressing BNIP3 and HIF-1α activity[^39]. Conversely, Karshovska et al. reported that HIF-1α positively regulates necroptosis in macrophages, possibly through a shift in mitochondrial function from ATP production to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in LPS-stimulated macrophages[^41]. Furthermore, HIF-1α was shown to promote necroptosis in dermal fibroblasts, an effect that was reversed by HIF-1α inhibition[^40]. These findings suggest that HIF-1α can actively induce or sustain necroptosis under certain conditions\n\n[[akt mTOR and necroptosis]]\n==The AKT/mTOR pathway is a well-studied intracellular signaling pathway involved in regulating cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism. AKT has a long history of well-documented anti-apoptotic function. Although relatively new studies suggest that this signaling cascade plays some role during necroptosis. Min et al. indicated that traumatic brain injury induces phosphorylation of both Akt/mTOR and RIPK3/MLKL pathways. Moreover, the implementation of RIPK3 inhibitor (GSK’872) reduces Akt/mTOR activity, suggesting that RIPK3 is an upstream Akt/mTOR regulator. [^51]\nSupporting the notion that RIPK3 is upstream of AKT or mTOR, AKT/mTOR inhibition did not significantly affect necrosome formation. But, reduce the cell death rate both by genetic and pharmacological AKT/mTOR inhibition. Interestingly, the combination of AKT and mTOR inhibition leads to much more significant necroptosis reduction than either one alone. In addition, during induction of necroptosis by TNF/zVAD, the authors reported increased phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR, as well as phosphorylation of direct target substrates such as GSK-3β, FOXO1, and the S6 ribosomal protein.[^52]\nThe Min et al.[^51] and Liu et al.[^52] groups speculated that AKT/mTOR influences necroptosis in two distinct ways—through ROS generation and apoptosis inhibition. First, FOXO1 is required for antioxidant defenses, and its degradation is directly controlled by the AKT pathway. Thus, over-activation of AKT/mTOR may reduce the cell’s antioxidant mechanisms and elevate ROS, which is an essential component for maintaining the necroptosis rate.[^52] Second, AKT inhibits caspase-8 by activating FLIPs; it is well-known that caspase-8 activity directly inhibits necrosome formation and, as a result, necroptosis execution.\n\n==Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) is a serine-threonine protein kinase that has been shown to have a significant role in neuroinflammation and gliosis. RIPK1 can influence GSK3β through the PI3K-Akt pathway activation. Interestingly, Liu et al. showed that inhibition of p-GSK3β by SB216763 reduces the activity of the RIPK1–RIPK3–MLKL pathway and decreases LDH release and the number of PI-positive cells. This suggests that GSK3β acts upstream of necroptosis or contributes to a feedback loop that sustains it.[^27].==\n\n[[RSK and necroptosis]]\n==It has been unclear how the caspase 8 blockade of necroptosis is eliminated naturally. One of the first proposed mechanisms, suggested by Yang and colleagues[^53], involves RSK-mediated phosphorylation of caspase-8 that leads to its inactivation. The 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family of proteins is a group of highly conserved Ser/Thr kinases that regulate diverse cellular processes, such as cell growth, cell motility, cell survival, and cell proliferation. In case of caspase 8 disactivation, RSKs phosphorylate procaspase 8 at Thr265.\nTo prove that Thr265 phosphorylation is crucial for necroptosis,  the authors presented a series of evidence. First, they labelled phosphorylated procaspase-8 at Thr265 with antibodies and showed that phosphorylation occurs following TNFα administration and does not occur in RIP3-, MLKL-, or RIP1- knockout cells. Second, they showed that phosphorylated procaspase-8 is part of the necrosome by immunoprecipitation and noted that it lacks enzymatic activity, as measured with a commercially available caspase-8 activity kit. Third, Yang et al. introduced a mutation at the Thr265 site in embryos and found that these embryos were viable and showed no sign of necroptotic death. Overall, RSK1 deletion phenocopies RIP3 or MLKL knockout in L929 cells. \nInterestingly, RSK1 association with the necrosome occurs only after MLKL is incorporated into the complex. Moreover, recruitment of RSK1 does not require caspase-8, FADD, or RIP1, since RSK1 can be recruited to the RIP3–MLKL complex induced by artificial RIP3 dimerization.\nThese data were confirmed by two other research groups. He et al. also showed that phosphorylated caspase-8 in TNF-treated mice suppresses caspase-8 activity in the cecum, which promotes necroptosis.[^54]\nWang et al. demonstrated that RSK3 mediates necroptosis by regulating phosphorylation of RIP3 in rat retinal ganglion cells during OGD injury, and that interference with RSK3 activity, both genetic and pharmacological, reduces necroptosis in RGC-5 cells after ischemic injury[^55].==\n \n==Triad3A, also known as RNF216, is a RING finger-containing E3 Ub ligase, and is a 2DL4 cytoplasmic binding partner. Triad3A regulates the degradation of RIPK3-interacting proteins to control necroptosis and expression of inflammatory cytokines. Triad3A inhibition accelerated cerebral I/R injury and cell death, which were largely dependent on necroptosis. In addition, Triad3A could interact with MLKL following ischemic stroke, indicating that Triad3A suppressed necroptosis through its association with MLKL[^29].==\n","x":-1647,"y":2300,"width":1557,"height":640},

Moreover, they proposed the term for this caspase-independent cell death with necrotic morphology - necroptosis. They were also the first to provide a specific receptor-interacting protein kinase inhibitor, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1).[^57] Following this research, the groups of Xu and Bruno independently began studying necroptosis in an oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro model of cortical neurons.[^42][^43]\n\nКритика параграфу 2\n1.

Наукові недоліки\nHoller et al. (2000) не просто \"відкрили RIP\", а показали, що RIPK1 є ключовим медіатором death receptor–induced non-apoptotic death.

Мовні проблеми\n\"cell death is a crucial factor in an ischemic in vivo model\" — це тавтологія, звучить дивно.\n\"began studying necroptosis\" — слабко, краще “extended the application of necroptosis research to OGD”.\nThe oxygen glucose deprivation model, the most frequently used model in ischemic in vitro studies, is commonly executed in two steps. First, the ischemic stage consists of changing the media to glucose-free and placing it in a gas chamber where oxygen is substituted with nitrogen for specific times. Immediately after the ischemic stage, cells were reperfused by removing the medium and replacing it with growth media with glucose, and cells were placed into an incubator with normoxic conditions. \n\n==Even though dozens of papers state that necroptosis executes cells as a consequence of oxygen-glucose deprivation, which cells predominantly undergo the cell death, and how prominent necroptosis is remains controversial.\nMeloni et al. showed that necrostatin-1 exerted only a small influence on the cell-survival rate in vitro, compared with an in vivo stroke model. They suggest this is due to a lack of necroptosis in cortical neurons, while glial cells are absent or present only at a bare minimum level and therefore lack sufficient TNFα secretion to promote the necroptosis pathway[^4]. However, the authors do not provide enough data to distinguish the type of cell death, and relatively new data available at the time of the publication of Meloni’s group states that necrostatin-1, as an inhibitor of RIPK1, not only represses the necroptosis cascade but also extrinsic apoptosis. Further support for a prominent glial role comes from Fan et al.[^8], who argued that MLKL, the key executor of necroptosis in the context of spinal-cord injury, is expressed mainly in microglia and astrocytes.\nOn the other hand, Yang et al. demonstrated that ischemia triggers rapid, neuron-dominant necroptosis within the first 3 days. After 5 days, the predominant cell type undergoing necroptosis shifts to astrocytes[^22]. These data support the findings of Han et al., which state that pMLKL (the major executor of necroptosis) colocalizes primarily with NeuN-labeled neurons[^23].==\n\n==Chen et al[^58] showed that RIPK1 and the necroptosis phenotype are caused by the combined effect of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and zVAD (caspase inhibitor). Even more peculiar, treatment with oxygen-glucose deprivation alone showed greater LDH leakage than the combined OGD/zVAD treatment. These data are consistent with those provided by Feng and colleagues[^59]. Moreover, the expression of key molecules such as RIPK3, RIPK1, and both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated MLKL shows no significant difference between OGD and zVAD, and may be even more prominent in OGD[^60].==\n","x":-1647,"y":1400,"width":1396,"height":804},

TNFR1 engagement in necroptosis is the best-characterized so far. TNF binding to the receptor may initiate three pathways. The first and most common is the RIPK1-dependent NF-κB pathway activation, which promotes cell survival and the inflammatory response by initiating Complex I. Complex I consists of TNF-receptor-associated factor 2, RIPK1, cIAP1, cIAP2, and LUBAC. cIAPs and LUBAC promote RIPK1 ubiquitination. This leads to the creation of a platform that promotes NF-κB and MAPK pathway activation. During severe perturbations such as ischemia, Complex I is inactivated by the lysine 63 deubiquitinase CYLD. CYLD removes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIPK1, thereby facilitating the transition to Complex II. Interestingly, Feng et al. reported that activation of the p38 MAPK pathway leads to upregulation of CYLD, which in turn promotes apoptosis or necroptosis in primary cortical neurons under ischemic conditions[^11]. The second pathway, mediated by Complex II, initiates apoptosis by CASP8.\n\nOn the other hand, Complex II can convert to a necrosome, mediated by CASP8 inactivation or RIPK3 overexpression.

Despite this, therapeutic options remain limited, with thrombolytic therapy being the only widely used clinical intervention. Although timely reperfusion can reduce tissue damage, extensive experimental and clinical evidence indicates that reperfusion itself can trigger additional injury. To address these limitations and dissect the underlying mechanisms, in vitro models of ischemia-reperfusion are particularly valuable due to their robustness, experimental controllability, and the ability to study selective cell types either alone or in defined combinations. Among these, oxygen–glucose deprivation followed by reperfusion (OGD/R) is a well-established in vitro model that reproduces key metabolic and hypoxic features of ischemic injury. Consequently, OGD/R has become a central experimental platform across multiple ischemia-related fields, including stroke[^7], retinal ischemia–reperfusion injury[^6], spinal cord injury[^8], glaucoma[^10], vascular dementia[^15], and intestinal and hepatic ischemia[^16,^30].\n\nCell loss during ischemic followed by reperfusion is a crucial component of ischemic pathogenesis that has been and remains in the scope of interest for multiple research groups.

		{"id":"4e0e9813df894a7a","type":"text","text":"In the context of ischemic damage, the major question is how CASP8 is inactivated.  \nThe first and easiest answer may be a lack of energy sources. Caspase activation, as well as apoptosis itself, is an energy-consuming process. Ferrari et al. demonstrated that ATP reduction or inhibition of ATP production reduces apoptosis, but **affects** more receptor-independent pathways that do not interact with necroptosis. Although ATP depletion shifts the cell death pathway to more necrotic ones, for this shift **to** occur, the energy depletion has to be severe and prolonged,that is rarely the case in common ischemic models, so ischemia-induced caspase-8 inhibition must rely on other mechanisms.\n\nOne such mechanism may be oxidative stress. H2O2 inhibits recombinant caspase 3 and caspase 8 activity[^1]. While small amounts of H2O2 promotes apoptosis, increased H2O2 concentration leads to significant caspase inhibition, and as a consequence, inhibits apoptosis[^3].  Generation of reactive oxygen species by hypothiocyanous acid with a TNFα combination promotes necroptosis through caspase 8 inhibition.[^2] Nitric oxide, a crucial reactive nitrogen species, also inhibits caspase 8 activity by S-nitrosylation in vivo and in vitro, both by an NO donor or through iNOS induction.  [^4] In addition, ROS promotes RIPK1 autophosphorylation and facilitates necrosome formation[]. However, reduction of ROS does not always affect the necroptosis pathway; butylated hydroxyanisole–mediated decrease of reactive oxygen species does not significantly affect necroptosis initiation.[^49][^50] It is possible that the influence of ROS is cell type dependent.\n\nAnother possible way for ischemic cells to inhibit CASP8 is by low pH due to increased lactic acid, which shifts intracellular pH to a more acidic pH through anaerobic metabolism. Low pH does not impair CASP8 activity in endothelial cells, and CASP8 function in RIPK1 cleavage still remains. [^2] However, low pH induces necroptosis in neurons through acid-sensing ion channel 1a, which can promote it via channel-independent direct interaction with RIPK1.

ZBP1 possesses RIP homotypic interaction motifs of RIP3 and initiates necroptosis through the RIPK3/MLKL pathway, overcoming RIPK1. This mechanism for protection during infection can be initiated during ischemia. The source of the  Z-nucleic acids is mitochondria; multiple studies have shown that these organelles are compromised during ischemia, and it is well-known that they have their own DNA. Lin and colleagues found that Z-DNA co-localizes at mitochondria at the early stage of hypoxia. ROS-induced oxidative stress can promote the formation of Z-DNA in certain regions, including mitochondria. Hypoxia disrupts the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to electron leakage and an increase in mitochondrial ROS production. To confirm the suggestions, Lin's group uses ddV, a mitochondrial DNA scavenger, and MitoQ, a mitochondria ROS inhibitor. As a consequence of the treatment ZBP1/RIPK3 signaling pathway has been compromised. Overall, this information elucidated why in some cases during ischemia, inhibition of CASP8 is not essential, compared to compare with necroptosis mediated by TNFa.[^1] However,  mtDNA is a ligand for the ZBP1 receptor and may induce necroptosis, but not in all circumstances. Nobuyuki et al. indicate that the ZBP1 receptor may even play a protective role. Cardiomyocytes respond to mtDNA administration by executing an inflammatory response without cell death. Interestingly, ZBP1 does not induce inflammation but instead inhibits it, suppressing RIPK3 and NLRP3. Furthermore, the authors reported the cardioprotective role of ZBP1 in the context of myocardial infarction.[^1]\nIn contrast, Zhao's group reported that myocardial infarction leads to necroptosis and that knockout of ZBP1 ameliorates the expression of MLKL and RIPK3, which are key molecules of necroptosis.[^2]","x":1760,"y":2000,"width":740,"height":680},

		{"id":"fe68c4c06419c297","type":"text","text":"### ZBP1 provides a RIPK1-bypass route to necroptosis and complicates the “CASP8 switch” model\n\nAlthough caspase-8 (CASP8) is often described as a gatekeeper that suppresses necroptosis by limiting RIPK3 activation, necroptotic signalling does not always require profound CASP8 inactivation. One reason is the existence of RIPK1-independent entry points into the pathway, most notably **Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1)**. ZBP1 is a cytosolic sensor of **Z-conformation nucleic acids** and contains **RHIM (RIP homotypic interaction motif) domains** that enable direct interaction with RHIM-containing partners such as **RIPK3**. Through this RHIM-mediated binding, ZBP1 can activate the **RIPK3–MLKL axis** without relying on canonical TNF/TNFR1-driven RIPK1 signalling, effectively providing an alternative “upstream trigger” for necroptosis.\n\nThis mechanism is best established in infection, where viral or endogenous Z-nucleic acids can engage ZBP1 to promote host defence–associated cell death. A similar logic may apply to ischemia, where **mitochondrial injury** is an early and prominent event. Mitochondria possess their own genome and are major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under hypoxic stress. Lin and colleagues reported that Z-DNA signals co-localise with mitochondria during early hypoxia and proposed that oxidative stress promotes Z-nucleic acid formation in susceptible genomic regions, including mitochondrial compartments. Consistent with this model, interventions targeting mitochondrial nucleic acids or mitochondrial ROS (e.g., **ddV**, a mitochondrial DNA scavenger, and **MitoQ**, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant) attenuated ZBP1–RIPK3 signalling. Together, these findings support a **mitochondria-to-ZBP1-to-RIPK3** axis that could permit necroptotic activation even when CASP8 is not fully suppressed, in contrast to the more “classical” TNFα-driven scenario where CASP8 inhibition is typically emphasised.[^1]\n\nHowever, ZBP1 signalling is not uniformly pro-death, and this is where your section becomes genuinely interesting (and where you must be careful). In cardiomyocytes, Nobuyuki et al. reported that exposure to mitochondrial DNA can provoke inflammatory signalling without overt cell death, and that ZBP1 may exert **protective** effects by dampening **RIPK3** and **NLRP3 inflammasome** activity, thereby limiting inflammatory escalation in myocardial infarction.[^1] In apparent contrast, Zhao’s group reported that myocardial infarction engages necroptotic signalling and that **ZBP1 knockout** reduces RIPK3/MLKL activation, consistent with a **pro-necroptotic** role for ZBP1 in that context.[^2] Taken together, these studies argue that ZBP1 is best viewed not as a universal necroptosis “on switch,” but as a **context-dependent node** whose net effect depends on cell type, timing, and the balance between inflammatory signalling and executional cell death.\n\n### ZBP1 also fits naturally into PANoptosis frameworks\n\nThe ZBP1 story also intersects with the concept of **PANoptosis**, where pyroptotic, apoptotic, and necroptotic components can be co-engaged within a single integrated signalling platform. In such settings, **RIPK3 and CASP8 are not necessarily strict antagonists**. Depending on scaffold composition and post-translational regulation, CASP8 can function as a suppressor of necroptosis, a driver of apoptosis, or part of a mixed complex that coordinates inflammatory death outputs. Ischemia, with simultaneous redox stress, mitochondrial damage, and cytokine signalling, is a plausible environment for such mixed-platform behaviour. Framing ZBP1 as a trigger that feeds into RIPK3 while inflammation recruits additional death machinery helps explain why ischemic cell death phenotypes may not follow a simple “CASP8 OFF → necroptosis ON” rule.","x":2060,"y":3140,"width":675,"height":1340,"color":"4"},

		{"id":"882baf6ec3482eb1","type":"text","text":"## other necroptosis components\nVDAC1\nUpon activation, MLKL targets not only the plasma membrane but also other membrane-bound organelles, such as lysosomes, nuclei, and mitochondria. In order to understand the role of MLKL in mitochondria, Wan and colleagues performed a set of experiments. They showed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting (WB) that MLKL directly interacts with VDAC1. Moreover, genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting MLKL or VDAC1 leads to decreased levels of ROS and Ca²⁺, and overall necroptosis suppression. VDAC1 is known to upregulate mitochondrial permeability, which leads to the leakage of cytochrome c, mtDNA, intracellular Ca²⁺, and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the authors speculated that MLKL promotes VDAC1 oligomerization. In addition to necroptosis, this pathway may also lead to intrinsic apoptosis, indicating a connection between different cell-death pathways and promoting the concept of PANoptosis. [^47][^48]\n\nCAMK2 \nExecution of the cell via necroptosis is not limited to MLKL-related permeabilization of the membrane. Regulated necrosis has another important substrate: calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CAMK2D). CaMKII is a serine-threonine kinase involved in calcium regulation. It is a well-validated nodal signal that promotes cardiomyocyte death through several pathways and can execute cell death independently of MLKL[^13]. Wang et al. showed that during brain ischemia in a mouse model, both in vitro and in vivo, MLKL activity is induced alongside CaMKII activity. RIPK3 induces CaMKII activity in both cardiomyocytes[^46] and cortical neurons[^32]. CaMKII promotes the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), so an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration leads to calcium overload. These findings demonstrate that RIPK3 is central to the necroptosis process and can activate necroptosis through multiple pathways[^32]. What is even more peculiar is that Zhang et al in cardiomyocytes indicate that RIPK1 and MLKL are not essential parts of necroptosis, in contrast to CaMKII and RIPK3[^46].\n\nHeat shock protein 90α (HSP90α) is a molecular chaperone and plays a crucial role in protein folding, stabilization, and trafficking under both normal and stress conditions. Wang et al. showed that HSP90 could directly bind to RIPK3 and RIPK1 and promote their stability. Moreover, both pharmacological (geldanamycin) and genetic inhibition of HSP90α lead to decreased necroptosis and reduced expression of both active and inactive forms of RIP3 and MLKL, and reduced necrosome assembly (RIP1–RIP3 complex formation) in cortical neurons, HT-29, and PC-12 cell lines. [^21]\n\nHIF1a\n==Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of over 100 genes involved in the cellular response to ischemic brain injury, including those linked to oxidative stress and cell death. Strangely, a connection between necrotptosis and HIF1a has not been studied explicitly. Yang et al. demonstrated that inhibition of necroptosis—either by pharmacological blockade using GSK’872 or by RIPK3 knockdown with siRNA—reduces both necroptosis signaling and HIF-1α expression in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic stroke[^18]. However, direct inhibition of HIF-1α did not significantly alter necroptosis markers, suggesting that HIF-1α may act as a downstream effector rather than a primary initiator of necroptotic signaling. Interestingly, under hypoxic conditions, both HIF-1α and BNIP3 are significantly upregulated and have been shown to promote necroptosis. Additionally, p53 activation can shift the balance from BNIP3-mediated necroptosis to apoptosis by disrupting cellular acidosis and suppressing BNIP3 and HIF-1α activity[^39]. Conversely, Karshovska et al. reported that HIF-1α positively regulates necroptosis in macrophages, possibly through a shift in mitochondrial function from ATP production to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in LPS-stimulated macrophages[^41]. Furthermore, HIF-1α was shown to promote necroptosis in dermal fibroblasts, an effect that was reversed by HIF-1α inhibition[^40]. These findings suggest that HIF-1α can actively induce or sustain necroptosis under certain conditions\n\n[[akt mTOR and necroptosis]]\n==The AKT/mTOR pathway is a well-studied intracellular signaling pathway involved in regulating cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism. AKT has a long history of well-documented anti-apoptotic function. Although relatively new studies suggest that this signaling cascade plays some role during necroptosis. Min et al. indicated that traumatic brain injury induces phosphorylation of both Akt/mTOR and RIPK3/MLKL pathways. Moreover, the implementation of RIPK3 inhibitor (GSK’872) reduces Akt/mTOR activity, suggesting that RIPK3 is an upstream Akt/mTOR regulator. [^51]\nSupporting the notion that RIPK3 is upstream of AKT or mTOR, AKT/mTOR inhibition did not significantly affect necrosome formation. But, reduce the cell death rate both by genetic and pharmacological AKT/mTOR inhibition. Interestingly, the combination of AKT and mTOR inhibition leads to much more significant necroptosis reduction than either one alone. In addition, during induction of necroptosis by TNF/zVAD, the authors reported increased phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR, as well as phosphorylation of direct target substrates such as GSK-3β, FOXO1, and the S6 ribosomal protein.[^52]\nThe Min et al.[^51] and Liu et al.[^52] groups speculated that AKT/mTOR influences necroptosis in two distinct ways—through ROS generation and apoptosis inhibition. First, FOXO1 is required for antioxidant defenses, and its degradation is directly controlled by the AKT pathway. Thus, over-activation of AKT/mTOR may reduce the cell’s antioxidant mechanisms and elevate ROS, which is an essential component for maintaining the necroptosis rate.[^52] Second, AKT inhibits caspase-8 by activating FLIPs; it is well-known that caspase-8 activity directly inhibits necrosome formation and, as a result, necroptosis execution.\n\n==Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) is a serine-threonine protein kinase that has been shown to have a significant role in neuroinflammation and gliosis. RIPK1 can influence GSK3β through the PI3K-Akt pathway activation. Interestingly, Liu et al. showed that inhibition of p-GSK3β by SB216763 reduces the activity of the RIPK1–RIPK3–MLKL pathway and decreases LDH release and the number of PI-positive cells. This suggests that GSK3β acts upstream of necroptosis or contributes to a feedback loop that sustains it.[^27].==\n\n[[RSK and necroptosis]]\n==It has been unclear how the caspase 8 blockade of necroptosis is eliminated naturally. One of the first proposed mechanisms, suggested by Yang and colleagues[^53], involves RSK-mediated phosphorylation of caspase-8 that leads to its inactivation. The 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family of proteins is a group of highly conserved Ser/Thr kinases that regulate diverse cellular processes, such as cell growth, cell motility, cell survival, and cell proliferation. In case of caspase 8 disactivation, RSKs phosphorylate procaspase 8 at Thr265.\nTo prove that Thr265 phosphorylation is crucial for necroptosis,  the authors presented a series of evidence. First, they labelled phosphorylated procaspase-8 at Thr265 with antibodies and showed that phosphorylation occurs following TNFα administration and does not occur in RIP3-, MLKL-, or RIP1- knockout cells. Second, they showed that phosphorylated procaspase-8 is part of the necrosome by immunoprecipitation and noted that it lacks enzymatic activity, as measured with a commercially available caspase-8 activity kit. Third, Yang et al. introduced a mutation at the Thr265 site in embryos and found that these embryos were viable and showed no sign of necroptotic death. Overall, RSK1 deletion phenocopies RIP3 or MLKL knockout in L929 cells. \nInterestingly, RSK1 association with the necrosome occurs only after MLKL is incorporated into the complex. Moreover, recruitment of RSK1 does not require caspase-8, FADD, or RIP1, since RSK1 can be recruited to the RIP3–MLKL complex induced by artificial RIP3 dimerization.\nThese data were confirmed by two other research groups. He et al. also showed that phosphorylated caspase-8 in TNF-treated mice suppresses caspase-8 activity in the cecum, which promotes necroptosis.[^54]\nWang et al. demonstrated that RSK3 mediates necroptosis by regulating phosphorylation of RIP3 in rat retinal ganglion cells during OGD injury, and that interference with RSK3 activity, both genetic and pharmacological, reduces necroptosis in RGC-5 cells after ischemic injury[^55].==\n \n==Triad3A, also known as RNF216, is a RING finger-containing E3 Ub ligase, and is a 2DL4 cytoplasmic binding partner. Triad3A regulates the degradation of RIPK3-interacting proteins to control necroptosis and expression of inflammatory cytokines. Triad3A inhibition accelerated cerebral I/R injury and cell death, which were largely dependent on necroptosis. In addition, Triad3A could interact with MLKL following ischemic stroke, indicating that Triad3A suppressed necroptosis through its association with MLKL[^29].==","x":80,"y":1220,"width":1086,"height":2040},

		{"id":"b3ec7c11bf20e996","type":"text","text":"In the context of ischemic injury, a central question is how caspase-8 (CASP8) activity becomes suppressed, thereby permitting necroptotic signaling. The first and easiest answer may be cellular energy failure, as caspase activation and apoptotic execution are ATP-dependent processes. Indeed, Ferrari et al. demonstrated that ATP depletion or pharmacological inhibition of ATP production reduces apoptotic cell death, but predominantly affects receptor-independent apoptotic pathways that do not directly intersect with necroptosis. However, although severe and sustained ATP depletion can shift cell death toward necrotic modalities, such conditions are rarely achieved in commonly used ischemic or OGD models. This suggests that ischemia-induced CASP8 inhibition cannot be explained by energy deficiency alone and likely involves additional regulatory mechanisms\n\nOxidative and nitrosative stress represent major candidates for CASP8 suppression under ischemic conditions. Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) directly inhibits recombinant caspase-3 and caspase-8 activity. Consistently, combined exposure to hypothiocyanous acid and TNFα promotes necroptosis through functional inhibition of CASP8. Reactive nitrogen species further contribute to this effect: nitric oxide inhibits CASP8 via S-nitrosylation both in vitro and in vivo, either through NO donors or iNOS induction. In parallel, reactive oxygen species enhance RIPK1 autophosphorylation and facilitate necrosome assembly, thereby reinforcing necroptotic signaling. Importantly, antioxidant interventions do not uniformly suppress necroptosis; for example, butylated hydroxyanisole reduces ROS levels without significantly affecting necroptosis initiation. These findings indicate that ROS-mediated regulation of CASP8 and necroptosis is context- and cell-type-dependent rather than universally required\n\nIntracellular acidosis represents an additional, cell-specific mechanism for CASP8 regulation during ischemia. Anaerobic metabolism and lactate accumulation lower intracellular pH, yet acidic conditions do not impair CASP8 activity or RIPK1 cleavage in endothelial cells. In contrast, low pH promotes necroptosis in neurons through activation of acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), which can enhance necroptotic signaling via channel-independent interactions with RIPK1. This divergence highlights that CASP8 inhibition during ischemia is not governed by a single universal mechanism but instead reflects cell-type-specific integration of metabolic stress, redox imbalance, and ion-channel signaling.","x":2172,"y":680,"width":716,"height":766,"color":"4"},
