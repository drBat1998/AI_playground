We mainly work with 
1. Fixed fluorescently labelled or Antibody stained tissue slices, organotypic slice culture, and cell culture.
2. Fluorescently labelled live cells and live organotypic slice culture.

We are interested to learn about: 
1. CD7 system capabilities relevant to our work
2. Optimal imaging workflows for fixed and live fluorescent samples. Including recommended acquisition settings, channel setup, illumination optimisation, and strategies to balance image quality, speed, and photobleaching.
3. Multi-channel acquisition: Best practices for configuring multiple fluorophores, avoiding bleed-through.
4. high-content workflows,
	1. time-lapse imaging, included but not limited to autofocus, illumination minimisation, drift correction, and data management, 
	2. Setting up automated multi-well or multi-region acquisition, plate scanning, experiment templates
5. z-stacking.
